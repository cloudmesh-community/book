On OSX you can install graphviz with

\begin{lstlisting}

that is called doteditor and can be installed with

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{itemize}

There are many more

\subsection{Usage}

To use Graphviz create a dot and run the following command.

\begin{lstlisting}
dot -Tpng filename.dot -o filename.png
\end{lstlisting}

This will create a png file. Other formats are also possible such as
svg, or PDF

\begin{lstlisting}
dot -Tsvg filename.dot -o filename.svg
dot -TPDF filename.dot -o filename.pdf
\end{lstlisting}

For inclusion in latex documents we recommend you create PDF output as it
has a much better quality and is smaller in size than png.

\subsection{Exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Develop a REST service that takes a graph as input and returns a rendered version of the graph in a specified format. Make sure you can pass the format as a parameter.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Develop a REST service that takes a graph as input and returns a URL of the rendered graph while storing the output onto a data server. The data server is another rest service, from which the result can be picked up. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
For IU students. Develop a REST service that takes a graph as input and returns a URL of the rendered graph while storing the output onto a data server. The data server is another rest service, from which the result can be picked up. Use box and/or google drive that are offered by IU as services. Make sure not to expose your passwords or access keys
