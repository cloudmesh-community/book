# Report List

Here we summarize the Projects and teams. Place the document in your
github folder under project/report.md. Please make sure to use proper
markdown and not githubs common mark. Once the reports are created they
will at one point also show up in the proceedings.

## CLOUD STORAGE-STORAGE-LOCAL PROJECTS

* see cloudmesh-storage to start. 
* all need to contribute to the local provider
* see the commandline interface.
* develop Python API.
* develop OpenAPI REST services for it.
* if this works technically we should be able to copy between all clouds as we have 
  all services for each cloud and each speaks the same protocol. This means your benchmark must include all clouds
