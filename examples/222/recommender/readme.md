# Code for recommender system in python from Mooc081XInformatics-kNN lecture

## Visulize the clusters using matplotlib
Use the createDataSet() definition in kNN.py for the example in the slides where
4 2D vectors with labels are discussed. Use the datingTestSet2.txt for the example
with 1000 3D vectors.
Use the driver python file to visulaize the clusters using maplotlib for both the 
generated data set and the sample dataset. 
```
python kNN-Driver.py
```
