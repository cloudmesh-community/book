# Overview

## Requirements

We recommend that you know one programming language using object
oriented programming. Although most activities are done in Python, this
programming language does not have to be pythin as it can easily be
learned throughout the semester. No background in cloud computing is
needed.


## Time Commitment

Any class at an university requires a significant time commitment. Due
to the different background the students have it is difficult to predict
the actual time needed. On average we see that students spend 6 hours on
the class if they do participate on a weekly basis. Students with little
programming experience spend up to 12 hours.

The biggest issue we see is that students may devote all their time to
others classes and not our Labs or assignments as they are more free
form than typical rigid homework assignment. However remember they are
still graded and need to be handed in on time.

## Course Material List

Course material will be distributed as ePubs. Howevr you will be
required to research also some topics on the on teh internet. Cloud
Computing is such an evolving field that changes frequently. To allow
you to learn the newest things, we ask you to help us updating the ePub
and to use additional resources as appropriate. 

The list includes:

* Introduction to Python
* Using Markdown for Academic Papers 
* Plagiarism Certificate
* ... 
* ![](images/tech-cover.jpg){width=50px} [Cloud Technologies, Gregor von Laszewski](https://github.com/cloudmesh/technologies/blob/master/vonLaszewski-cloud-technologies.epub?raw=true)

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/proceedings-fa18/tree/master/project-report>

  A single page has about 1000 words in ACM format. References are managed in
  bibtex as documented in:

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/vonLaszewski-writing-markdown.epub?raw=true> 


## Help

If you take our class, please use piazza to ask for help. This is
important as questions may be answered by different TAs based on
expertise. Please, do not send e-mail to the instructors. TAs are 
not allowed to answer e-mail send to them personally.

## How to Take this Class

This class is attended by students with greatly different backgrounds
and time schedules. To be most flexible and adress all students there
are two different ways on how you can take this class.

* Way 1: *Free form.* The preferred way for most students. Here you
  simply look at the Syllabus table for the semester and identify
  whatever section you feel like reading. However, make sure you follow
  our weekly **Lab activities**.

* Way 2: *Linear form.* The lecture notes are just like a book in the
  syllabus table. We add sections in a logical fashion to the book
  once they become available. The section form a linear progression
  and you can go through the book in linear fashion. 

Please note that we have set asside a recommended set of weekly
*Lab activities*. These are integrated into your final grade, so it is
important to do them. They also will let us know if you have any issues
and if you participate in this class. As such your activity will be
integrated in a participation grade. You certainly can work ahead. Lab 
activities are simply graded with pass fail. 

Typically,  Lab activities are supposed to be completed within one week
as it allerts us of problems you might have that we can than address.

Lab activities will not receive any credit if you are a residential
student and the activity has not been completed within one week.
However, residential students  will get two **Delay a Lab for One
Week** passes that you can apply to any of the Labs and stil get credit.
  
If you are an online student we recommend that you finish the Labs also
in the same week. However, you will get eight **Delay a Lab for One
Week** passes that you can apply to any of the Labs. 


Please not that if you would need to postone a lab for two weeks, you
need to use two passes. Lab passes expire one month before the last day
of class. You will have to complete all labs by that time. No credit
will be given if this dealine is missed for any delayed Labs as TAs must
focus their attention on project support.
   
## Assignments

Besides the Lab's, we have only three main assignments in this class.
The Lab's will prepare you towards achieving these assignments. Students
that skip the Lab's will miss some important aspects that make their
projects easier to execute.

The first two assignments are created in such a way that they could (but
do not have to) support your class project. The three
assignments are:

* Section contributions
* Chapter contributions
* Project

The assignments will be determined on individual basis within the first
3 weeks while making sure there is no overlep with other students or
teams. This will help avoiding plagiarizm.

As part of the class, we expect you to get familiar with topics related
to cloud computing beyond what we have written in the lecture notes.
This is done in Sections, Chapters with Examples. The assignments
related to them are done so you do not have to do tests or exams as part
of this class. They showcase your understanding of the field makeing
tests and exams unnecessary.

### Section

A section is a small document (usually about 200 words but no less) that
explains a topic which is not yet in the handbook or improves an
existing section significantly. It is typically multi-paragraphs long
and can even include an example if needed. Sections can be theoretical,
or explain a programming related aspects including an example. 
Typically an A student contributes 2 such sections.

Sample sections contributed by students include:

   * Section Microsoft Nafik Data Center in the Datacenter Chapter
   * Section Lambda Expressions in *Introduction to Python*

### Chapter with Example

A chapter is a much longer topic and is a coherent description of a
topic related to cloud computing. A chapter could either be a review of
a topic or a detailed technical contribution. The minimal length of a
chapter is about 800-1000 words. However you will see that it is much
easier to write more than less. You will be contributing a unique and
**significant** chapter that can be used by other students in the class
and introduces the reader to a general topic related to the topic of the
class.
  
Chapters can be theoretical, but most often students prefer the creation
of practical contributions.  When doing a practical section, it is
expected to develop a practical example demonstrating how to use a
technology. The chapter and the practical example can be done together.
We do not like to use the term tutorial in our writeup *at all*. We will
not accept screenshots for simple command line examples ore programs.  A
sample of a student contributed chapter is

* GraphQL


:warning: *It is expected from you that you self identify a section
or a chapter as this shows competence in the area of cloud
computing. If however you do not know what to select, you must attend
an online hour with us in which we identify sections and chapters with
you. The emphasis here is that we do not decide them for you, but we
identify them **with** you. Technologies that are not repeatable due
to enormous cost or licensing issues need to get prior
approval. Naturally, the technology you write about needs to be related
to cloud computing.*



### Project

The objective of the project is to define a clear problem statement
and create a framework to address that problem as it relates to cloud
computing. 

A project is the major activity that you chose as part of your class.
This includes a project report* or *manual* and working project code.
You will create a significant non-trivial project related to cloud
computing and cloud engineering. Up to three people can collaborate. The
project could be built on top of a previous project but must have
significant additions or modifications. If a previous project is used, a
detailed discussion is to be held on what has been improved.

In this class it is especially important to address the reproducibility
of the deployment. A test and benchmark, possibly including a
*downloadable* dataset, must be used to verify the correctness of your
approach. 


#### License

All projects are developed under an open source license, such as the
Apache 2.0 License. You will be required to add a LICENCE.txt file and
describe how other software, if used, can be reused in your project. If
your project uses different licenses, please add a README.md file that
describes which packages are used and what licenses these packages have.
    
#### Project Report

A project report is to be delivered and continuously improved throughout
the semester in github. It includes not just the analysis of a topic,
but a short description of the Architecture and code, with
**benchmarks** and demonstrated use. Obviously it is longer than a term
paper and includes descriptions about reproducibility of the
application. A README.md is provided that describes how others can
reproduce your project and run it. Remember that tables and figures do
not count towards the paper length. The following minimal length is
required:

-    800 words, one student in the project
-   1200 words, two students in the project
-   1600 words, three students in the project
  
The report is written in markdown and checked into github.
A Report could be substituted by a manual and benchmarks.
  

For certain projects, the requirement of a report can be waved or is
reduced while replacing it with more programming activities. This includes 

* Any project that enhances cloudmesh
* Building a large cloud cluster with Rasperri Pi's
* Any Application project showcasing NIST big data reference architecture 
  use (there is a hard deadline of the NIST project by Dec 1st).

However you still have to do a manual and usage examples, benchmarks and 
pytests for them.

  
#### Project Code

This is the **documented** and **reproducible** code and scripts that
allows a TA to replicate the project. In case you use images, they must
be created from **scratch locally** and may not be uploaded to services
such as dockerhub. You can, however, reuse approved vendor uploaded
images such as from ubuntu or centos or other linux distributions. All
code, scripts, and documentation must be uploaded to github.com under
the class specific github directory. Reproducability must be shown with
pytests.


#### Project Data

Data is to be hosted on IU's Google drive, if needed. If you have larger
data, it should be downloaded from the internet. It is your
responsibility to develop a download program. The data **must** not be
stored in GitHub. You are expected to write a python program that
downloads the data either from the Web or IU's data storage.

#### Work Breakdown

This is an appendix to the document that describes in bullet form who
did what in the project. This section comes on a new page after the
references. It does not count towards the page length of the document.
It also includes explicit URLs to the git history that documents the
statistics to demonstrate more than one student has worked on the
project. If you can not provide such a statistic or all check-ins have
been made by a single student, the project has shown that they have not
properly used git. Thus, points will be deducted from the project.
Furthermore, if we detect that a student has not contributed to a
project, we may invite the student to give a detailed oral presentation
of the project.

#### Bibliography

All bibliography has to be provided in a bibtex file that **MUST**
either be validated with **jabref** or with **emacs**. There is **NO
EXCEPTION** to this rule. Please be advised doing references right takes
some time so you want to do this early and throughout the semester. What
would take less than 5 minutes a week, could quickly add up to multiple
hours at the end of the semester. Please note that exports of Endnote or
other bibliography management tools do not lead to properly formatted
bibtex files, despite their claims of doing so. You will have to clean
them up and we recommend to do it the other way around. Hence, the
easiest way to manage your bibliography is with jabref or emacs. Make
sure **labels** only include characters from [a-zA-Z0-9-]. Use dashes
and not underscore and colons (`_` ,`:`) in the label. We will deduct
points if you submit an invalid bibtex file to github. So please make
sure your file is validated. You can even create your own checks with
tools such as biber.

### Project Deliverables


In general, any project must be deployable by the TA. If it takes hours
to deploy your project, please talk to us before final
submission. This should not be the case. Also, if it takes 100 steps,
we are sure you can automate them ... as you are likely doing something
wrong or have not thought about cloud computing where we tend to
automate most of the steps.

You have plenty of time to execute a wonderful project but you need to
work consistently on it. Starting one week before the deadline will
not work. 

In general your deliverables will include the following 
(We will address and explain them in a Lab):

- Provide benchmarks.

- Take results in a cloud services and your local PC (ex:
  Chameleon Cloud, echo kubernetes). Make sure your system can be
  created and deployed based on your documentation. 

- Each team member must provide a benchmark on their computer and a
  cloud IaaS, where the cloud is different from each team member. 
  
- We require you rto write one or more pytest's that deploys, run,
  kill, view, clean that deploys your environment, runs application,
  kills it, views the result and cleans up after wards. 

- For python use a requirements.txt file and develop a `setup.py` so
  your code can be installed with `pip install .` 

- For docker use a Dockerfile 

- (If not exempt) write a report that typically includes the following sections:

  * Abstract
  * Introduction
  * Design
    * Architecture
  * Implementation
    * Technologies Used
  * Results
    * Deployment Benchmarks
    * Application Benchmarks
  * (Limitations)
  * Conclusion
  * (Work Breakdown)

* Your paper will **not** have a *Future Work* section as this implies
   that you will do work in future and your paper is incomplete. Hence
   we would not grade it. Instead, you can use an optional "Limitations"
   section.

* Do communicate your status and add a *Workbreakdown* section in which you outline
  which tasks need to be done and by whom in case of a group
  project. Once you have done a task simply include maker a task as
  follows

  ```* [done, Gregor] This was gregors task to showcase how to mark it```


## Submission of sections and chapters and projects

Sections and subsections are to be added to the `book` github repo. Do
a pull request. Initially they will be managed in your own github repo
that we will set up for you. They will be added to the book after they
have been reviewed and approved. 

The headline of the section needs to be marked with a
:hand: if you are working on it and marked with a :smiley: if you want it
to be graded and have included all hids for people that contributed to that
section.

In addition, simply add them to your README.yml file in your github repo.
Add the following to it (I am using a18-516-18 as example). 

Please look at <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa18-516-18> and <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudmesh-community/fa18-523-62/master/README.yml>
for an examples. Please note that if you work in a group, the code and report is supposed to be only stored 
in the first hid mentioned in the group field. If you store it in multiple directories your project will be rejected.

    section:
        - title: title of the section 1
          url: https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/chapters/...
        - title: title of the section 2
          url: https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/chapters/...
        - title: title of the section 3
          url: https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/chapters/...
    chapter:
        - title: title of the chapter
          url: https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa18-516-18/blob/master/chapter/whatever.md
group: fa18flys-523-62 fa18-523-69
          keyword: whatever
    project:
        - title: title of the project
          url: url in your hid space or that of your partner
          group: fa18-523-62 fa18-523-69
          keyword: kubernetes, NIST, Database
          code: the url to the code
    other:
        - activity: spell checked md document
          url: put url here


You **MUST** run yamllint on the README.yml file. YAML errors will cause
point deductions. Any invalid yaml file will result in point deductions.
Please keep your yaml file valid at any time. Our scripts depend on it.
The yaml file will also be used to create a list for TAs to review your
deliverables. If it's not in the yaml file it will not be reviewed.
Please note that it is not sufficient to just run yamllint, but to
compare your yaml file carefully with the README.yml examples. Make sure
you do the indentation with 2 spaces, do not use the TAB character and
make sure you use the list and attribute organization with proper dash
placement. Work with the TAs if you have difficulties. If you copy, only
copy from the raw content in github..

## Participation 

In addition to these artifacts, there will also be a participation
component in class that will be determined based on your productive
contributions to piazza to help others that have questions and
contributions to the books to, for example, improve sections with
spelling, grammer or content. We can see from the github history if
you conducted such improvements. Make sure that technical
contributions, work on all OSes and are not just targeting a
single OS if the improvement is of general nature (exceptions apply).
