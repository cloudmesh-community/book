# How to take this class

This class is attended by a variety of students with different
backgrounds an time schedules. To be most flexible and adress all
students there are three different ways on how you can take this
class.

* Way 1: Free form. The preferred way for most students. Here you
  simply look at the Syllabus table and identify whatever section you
  feel like reding. The sections that are released are marked with
  :white_check_mark:. Note that the book may include sections that are
  not marked in the syllabus. YOu do not have to read such sections.

* Way 2: Linear form. The lecture notes are just like a book. We add
  sections in a logical fashion to the book once they become
  available. The section form a linear progression and you can go
  through the book in linear fashion. On weekly basis we may add a new
  section. Such sections are marked for one week with the icon :new:
  after about three weeks time all :new: icons will be removed. The
  icon is there to help you identifying sections that may have been
  added to section taht logically fit better in an earlier section, than
  linearly at the end

* Way 3: Weekly guided progress. Other students may prefer
  a more guided approach to the class. Thus we will provide here a
  summary of what you can do on a weekly activity to stay up to
  date. We will add to the weekly schedule once new items become
  available. We also augment them with experiments/exercises that are not
  graded or reviewed, but that you could discuss with the
  TAs. Assignments are not listed in this weekly view and you are
  responsible to identify the schedule for them.

      Tip: pick an area you can contribute, use libcloud to interface
      with your cloud that you have chosen. Remember you do not have
      to do all the clouds at this time, you can each week from now
      work with a different cloud if you like. It is
