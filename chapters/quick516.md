# How to take this class

This class is attended by a variety of students with different
backgrounds and time schedules. To be most flexible and adress all
students there are three different ways on how you can take this
class.

* Way 1: Free form. The preferred way for most students. Here you
  simply look at the Syllabus table and identify whatever section you
  feel like reding. The sections that are released are marked with
  :white_check_mark:. Note that the book may include sections that are
  not marked in the syllabus. You do not have to read such sections.

* Way 2: Linear form. The lecture notes are just like a book. We add
  sections in a logical fashion to the book once they become
  available. The section form a linear progression and you can go
  through the book in linear fashion. On weekly basis we may add a new
  section. Such sections are marked for one week with the icon :new:
  after about three weeks time all :new: icons will be removed. The
  icon is there to help you identifying sections that may have been
  added to section that logically fit better in an earlier section, than
  linearly at the end

* Way 3: Weekly guided progress. Other students may prefer
  a more guided approach to the class. Thus we will provide here a
  summary of what you can do on a weekly activity to stay up to
  date. We will add to the weekly schedule once new items become
  available. We also augment them with experiments/exercises that are not
  graded or reviewed, but that you could discuss with the
  TAs. Assignments are not listed in this weekly view and you are
  responsible to identify the schedule for them.

    * Week Aug 20

      Get familiar with the class structure. Read: Preface; Class
      Overview; Exercise: Find a computer you can do the class
      programming on (tablet and chrombook will not suffice). If you
      like to do a Raspberry PI project or do not have a computer
      order a Raspberry PI.

    * Week Sep 3

      Read: Definition of Clouds; find alternative definitions on the
      internet; set up accounts on google, github; get hid directory;
      start READNE.md, notebook.md; Read: Python, do some python
      programming; understand classes

    * Week Sep 10

      Read: docopts and experiment; Read Data Center section and
      contribute to that section; complete setup of your class
      computer; use pyenv

    * Week Sep 17

      Read Architectures section; Read NIST section; Learn about REST;
      learn about swagger; Experiment with swagger code gen

    * Week Sep 24 and Oct 1

      Read about Virtual machines; Start a VM on a cloud of your
      choice. At minimum use Virtualbox. To do the assignment Read the
      Infrastructure as a Service Section. Focus on the section for
      the cloud you have chosen; Read up on Chameleon Cloud, start a
      VM on chameleon cloud; Participate in within a new version of
      cloudmesh in python which is checked in
      [github :cloud:](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm)

      Tip: pick an area you can contribute, use libcloud to interface
      with your cloud that you have chosen. Remember you do not have
      to do all the clouds at this time, you can each week from now
      work with a different cloud if you like. It is
      recommended that you try programming with libcloud! To prepare
      yourself for the project.

    * Oct 10

      to deploy an mqtt server on your computer and use it. Optionally

      Read the section on GraphQL (if that section is
      ready). Experiment with GraphQL. Develop an inventory of compute
      resources in GraphQL, that you populate and quesry. Develop a
      NIST OpenAPI framework for a computer inventory. Identify
      adbatages and disadvanteges opf using GraphQL. When are ther
      instances that GraphQL does not work well (Tip: compare to
      MongoDB).

      please use echo docker swarm and/or kubernetes. Develop a
      service you can deploy and test. Do not expose andy insecure
      services. If in doubt ask the TAs. Conduct a benchmark of the
      service.
