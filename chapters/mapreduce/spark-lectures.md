Spark
=====

This section covers an introduction to Spark that is split up into eight
parts. We discuss Spark background, RDD operations, Shark, Spark ML,
Spark vs Other Frameworks.

Motivation for Spark
--------------------

In this section we discuss about the background of Spark and core
components of Spark.

Spark RDD Operations
--------------------

In this section we discuss about the background of RDD operations along
with other transformation functionalty in Spark.

Spark DAG
---------

In this section we discuss about the background of DAG (direct acyclic
graphs) operations along with other components like Shark in the earlier
stages of Spark.

Spark vs. other Frameworks
--------------------------

In this section we discuss about the real world applications that can be
done using Spark. And also we discuss some comparision results obtained
from experiments done in Spark along with Frameworks like Harp, Harp
DAAL, etc. We discuss the benchmarks and performance obtained from such
experiments.
