# Hadoop {#sec:hadoop-introduction}

Hadoop is an open source framework for storage and processing of large datasets on commodity clusters. Hadoop internally uses its own file system called HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).

The motivation for Hadoop was introduced in Section [Mapreduce]{#s-mapreduce}

Hadoop and the Yarn Resource Manager
------------------------------------

In this section we discuss about Yarn resource manager and novel
components added to the Hadoop framework in case of improving the
performance and minimizing fault tolerance.

PageRank
--------

In this section we discuss about a real world problem that can be solved
using the MapReduce technique. PageRank is a problem solved by the
earliest stages of the Google.inc. In this section we discuss about the
theoretical background about this problem and we discuss how this can be
solved using the map reduce concepts.
