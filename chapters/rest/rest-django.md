# Django REST Framework

Django REST framework is a large toolkit to develop Web APIs. The
developers of the framework provide the following reasons for using it
aggording to the developers of that module:

> 1. The Web browsable API improves usability.
> 2. Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
> 3. Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources. 
> 4. Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if
>   you do not need the more powerful features. 
> 5. Extensive documentation,
>   and great community support. 
> 6. Used and trusted by internationally
>   recognised companies including Mozilla, Red Hat, Heroku, and
>   Eventbrite."

To document your django framework with Swagger you can look at this example:

However, we believe that for our purposes the approach to use conexion
from an OpenAPI is much more appealing, also using conexion and also 
flask for the REST service is easier to acomplish. Django is a large
package that will take mor time to getting used to.
