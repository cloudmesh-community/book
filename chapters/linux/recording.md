# Terminal Recordings

In Linux and OSX it is possible to easly record and replay a terminal session.
There are several programs that can do this. A good overview article about it is given at

* <https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/linux-terminal-recording-tools/>

From these programs we have tried

* script, which is preinstalled and you do not have it immediatly available
* TermRecord that also depends on ttyrec, so you need to install this as well


## TermRecord

### OSX

```bash
$ brew install ttyrec
$ pip install TermRecord
```

To use it simply invoke

```bash
$ TermRecord -o recording.html
```

To replay open the html page in a browser. Befor eyou publish it for example in
the docs folder in a github repository, please make sure you have not exposed
any information that allows others to compromise your system.

In case you use chrome you can replay it also from the commandline with

```bash
$ google-chrome /tmp/test.html
```

## Screencapture

OSX SHIT-COMMAND - 4 Screen capture

commandline: screencapture a.gif
