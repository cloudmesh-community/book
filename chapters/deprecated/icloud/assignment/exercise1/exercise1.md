Basic Statistics with Hadoop
============================



The idea of this exercise is to get you started with Hadoop and the
MapReduce concept. You may have already looked at the WordCount example,
both serial and Hadoop implementations. This problem is similar to
WordCount except that you will be computing the basic statistics such as
min, max, average, and standard deviation of a given data set.

The input to the program will be a text file carrying exactly one
floating point number per line. The output should include *min, max,
average, and standard deviation* f these numbers.

Files
-----

A test input file is available as a separate attachment. The statistics
values for this input are *Min: 0.01 Max: 0.99 Avg: 0.50 StdDev: 0.2817*

Deliverables
------------

You will need to complete the source code and write a report. Zip your
work into a file with the name `username_exercise1.zip` (replace
*username* with your own) and submit the following:

-   Complete source code

-   A document with the following details:

    -   Transformation of data during the computations, i.e. data type
        of key, value

    -   The data structure used to transfer between Map and Reduce
        phases

    -   How the data flow happens through disk and memory during the
        computation

Evaluation
----------

The point total for this exercise is 5.

-   Correctness of the source code (2 points)

-   Completeness of the report (3 points)
