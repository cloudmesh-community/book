HBase FreqIndexBuilder
======================



\TODO{Hyungro: fix exercise and replace project where appropriate.}
Write an HBase FreqIndexBuilder program to build an inverted index table
which has the unique term's occurrences in all documents from the
clueWeb09 dataset. Each row record of columnfamily "frequencies" is
unique, where the rowkey is the unique term stored in byte format,
column name is the documentId that contains this term, and value is the
term frequency shown per document. Note that each row has multiple
columns. The result must be loaded to HBase clueWeb09IndexTable. Figure
1 shows the schema of clueWeb09IndexTable.

Introduction
------------

HBase FreqIndexBuilder is an advanced WordCount program which counts the
number of occurrences of each word in a given text input dataset and
also stores the related document name (identification number) as HBase
inverted index records. These Inverted indices for text data are built
for supporting efficient searches in a huge set of text data.

What is Inverted Index?
-----------------------

Figure 2 shows an example of an inverted index. For a given set of
documents, each composed of a series of terms (words), it records the
following information: for each term, which subset of documents contains
it in their texts.

To build these inverted indices, we reuse the ClueWeb09 dataset from
before, which was created to support research on information retrieval
and related human language technologies. The dataset is used by several
tracks of the TREC conference. New inverted index table schemas are
designed as shown in Figure 1.

In the clueWeb09IndexTable table each term will have the same structure,
with term as rowkey, values contained in documentId, and the occurrence
of the term within this document shown. Our goal is to write an HBase
program which generates an inverted index table by extracting the
information from the ClueWeb09 dataset.

Mapper and Main Program
-----------------------

Now we are going to implement the HBase FreqIndexBuilder program. As
opposed to WordCount, our implementation only consists of two main
parts:

-   Mapper

-   Main program

This type of application is called ?Map-Only? parallel application.

### Mapper

A Mapper overrides the "map" function from the Class
"org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TableMapper\
\<Text, LongWritable\>", which provides \<key, value\>pairs as the
input. A Mapper implementation may output \<key,value\>pairs using the
provided Context. \<key, value\>of this map function is \<rowkey,
content\>, where the key is the rowkey of an HBase record related to a
specified URI, and the content is the stored text of that URI. Your Map
task should output \<word, \<docId, frequency\>\>for each word in the
content of text.

### Pseudocode

``` {.java language="Java"}
void Map(key, value) {
    for each word x in the content of a hbase record:
    context.write(x, );
}
```

Main Program
------------

Again, the main function has been provided as standard initialization,
and you may modify it to fit your own style. See the examples of using
TableMapReduceUtil.initTableMapperJob and
TableMapReduceUtil.initTableReducerJob.

Edit, compile and run your code
-------------------------------

The sketch code is stored within the provided VirtualBox image. You can
use linux text editor vi/vim to add your code.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ cd /root/MoocHomeworks/HBaseInvertedIndexing/
$ vim src/iu/pti/hbaseapp/clueweb09/FreqIndexBuilderClueWeb09.java
$ cd /root/MoocHomeworks/HBaseInvertedIndexing/
$ ./compileAndExecFreqIndexBuilderClueWeb.sh
```
