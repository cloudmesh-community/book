What is PageRank?
-----------------

The web search engine is a typical distributed system on the Internet.
It is designed to search for information on the World Wide Web. The
search results are generally presented in a list of results and are
often called hits. PageRank is a well-known web graph ranking algorithm
that helps Internet users sort hits by their importance.

PageRank calculates a numerical value for each element of a hyperlinked
set of webpages, which reflects the probability that a random surfer
will access that page. The process of PageRank can be understood as a
Markov Chain which requires iterative calculations to converge. An
iteration of PageRank calculates the new access probability for each
webpage based on values calculated in the previous iteration. The
process will repeat until the number of current iterations is bigger
than predefined maximum iterations, or the Euclidean distance between
rank values in two subsequent iterations is less than a predefined
threshold that controls the accuracy of the output results.

![Mathematical PageRank for a simple network in Wikipedia](section/icloud/assignment/exercise2/pagerankexample.png)
{#fig:pagerankexample}

@fig:pagerankexample shows a web graph consisting of 11
vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, G1, G2, G3, G4, G5. Each vertex refers to a
unique webpage, and the directed edge means there is one link from the
source webpage to the target webpage. The percentage on each vertex
represents the rank value of each webpage.

Notes
-----

You can implement a sequential PageRank that can run on desktops or
laptops. But when processing larger input data, like web graphs
containing more than a million webpages, you need to run the PageRank
application in parallel so that it can aggregate the computing power of
multiple compute nodes. Currently, in both industry and academia, the
study of large-scale web or social graphs has become increasingly
popular. In one published paper, the job execution engines that claim to
support large-scale PageRank include: MPI, Hadoop, Dryad, Twister,
Pregel.

Formula
-------

Equation [\[eq:pagerank\]](#eq:pagerank){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:pagerank"} is the formula to calculate the rank value for
each webpage. We will learn this formula by applying it to the case in
Figure [\[fig:pagerankexample\]](#fig:pagerankexample){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:pagerankexample"}. There are 11 webpages in
Figure [\[fig:pagerankexample\]](#fig:pagerankexample){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:pagerankexample"}, which include: A, B, C, D, E, F, G1,
G2, G3, G4, G5. Assuming the probability distribution for a web surfer
accessing all these 11 pages in current iteration is {PR(A), PR(B),
PR(C), \... PR(G5)}, then the probability for the surfer to access Page
B in the next iteration is:\
$PR(B) = PR(D)/2 + PR(E)/3 + PR(F)/2 + PR(C) + PR(G1)/2 + PR(G2)/2 + PR(G3)/2$\
In a general case, the PageRank value for any page u can be expressed
as:

$$\label{eq:pagerank}
PR(u) = \sum_{v \in Set} \frac{PR(V)}{L(v)}$$

The vertices seen in the right of the formula contain all the webpages
that point to target webpage 'u'. The L(v) refers to the out degree of
each webpage in the vertices set. The initial rank values of each
webpage, like PR'(u), can be any double value. After several iteration
calculations, the rank values converge to the stationary distribution
regardless of what their initial values are.

Damping factor
--------------

The PageRank theory holds that even an imaginary surfer who is randomly
clicking on links will eventually stop clicking. The probability, at any
step, that the person will continue is a damping factor d. Various
studies have tested different damping factors, but it is generally
assumed that the damping factor will be around 0.85. The formula
considering damping factor is shown in
Equation [\[eq:pagerankwithdf\]](#eq:pagerankwithdf){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:pagerankwithdf"}. N refers to the total number of unique
urls.

$$\label{eq:pagerankwithdf}
PR(u) = \frac{1-d}{N} + d * \sum_{v \in Set} \frac{PR(V)}{L(v)}$$

Hadoop PageRank DataFlow
========================

In this exercise, we have provided a sketch code which contains three
MapReduce jobs for you to implement:

-   CreateGraph (done): add one column, 'initial pagerank value', to the
    input pagerank adjacency matrix (AM). Then pass it to the PageRank
    program to calculate the pagerank values.

-   PageRank (your implementation): take the transformed AM matrix and
    calculate pagerank values for all pages.

-   Cleanup Results: remove the targetUrls column and output
    **(sourceUrl, pagerank value)** as the final result.

The detail dataflow can be seen in
Figure [\[fig:hadoopdataflow\]](#fig:hadoopdataflow){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:hadoopdataflow"}. Part 1 and Part 3 are given as full
solutions in this pipeline; you will implement the 2nd part of the
PageRank program.

![Hadoop PageRank
dataflow[]{label="fig:hadoopdataflow"}](section/icloud/assignment/exercise2/hadoopdataflow.png){width="10cm"}

Normally for any Hadoop MapReduce program, input data is uploaded and
stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) before computation
in order to generate **(key, value)** pairs to the mapper. Initially,
the PageRank input data is stored in the format of adjacency matrix as a
file(s) in the local file system. Then it will be uploaded to the HDFS
and distributed across the compute nodes. Hadoop framework reads the
application records from HDFS with the InputFormat interface and
generates **(key, value)** pair input streams. Each Map function
produces zero or more intermediate **(key, value)** pairs by consuming
one input (key, value) pair. For this PageRank program, the map function
applies the calculation $\frac{PR(v)}{L(V)}$ to each **(key, value)**
pair, where the key is the unique id or name of the webpage and the
value contains the current rank value of the webpage and its out link
information. Map tasks then generate intermediate (key, value) pairs,
whose value is the partial rank value of every webpage. Each reduce task
aggregates all the partial values of specific webpages by applying the
provided
Equation [\[eq:pagerankwithdf\]](#eq:pagerankwithdf){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:pagerankwithdf"}. The aggregated global rank values are
written back to HDFS, which in turn is used as input in the next set of
iterations, if any. \"Hadoop - PageRank\" in
Figure [\[fig:hadoopdataflow\]](#fig:hadoopdataflow){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:hadoopdataflow"} shows an example for the PageRank data
processing.
