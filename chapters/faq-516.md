## Why have the individual lectures been removed from the resources section?

We identified that someone after almost three weeks has not looked at
the ePub and missed valuable information. To force students to look at
the epub we have removed the direct links to the md files in piazza
`Resources` section. Instead we still leave the links to the md file
sin the syllabus so that you can still get to them from the syllabus.
This way also room for error is minimized as we only have to update
one file wit the location and not two.

The little clouds in the ePub are automatically created and provide
a direct link to the md file for which the content follows.

Essentially instead of making it real convenient not to read the epub,
we make it now real convenient that you read it while *hiding* the
inks a bit in the syllabus md file.


## Opening Epub properly in Linux
We recently noticed that not all the symbols, which are pretty important, are visible when we open the Epub in Linux using Calibre.

Before trying to putting time on fixing the Calibre, I tried couple of other software and seems like  Bookworm can open the Epub correctly. I tried this in Ubuntu 18.04 (unity). You can follow the instructions here for installing Bookworm.

## Microsoft Edge for Epub
On Windows 10 you need to have version 42.17134 for edge to properly display an epub.

## Project format: Markdown allowed

I have been working with some students on using Markdown for the
format of the project report and it turns out to be possible to write
your project report in markdown.

Hence, you have the option to use Markdown or LaTeX. We still use
bibtex for management of the references in markdown.



tips for use of markdown for project report writing:


```
labels for citation in markdown are [@label]
```

use of commands

````md
```bash
$ ls
```
````

use of python

````md
```python
print("hello")
```
````

do not use quotes when you ought to use italics: This technology is
called "docker" is wrong, but this technology is called *docker* is
right.  Use # to manage your sections not underscores or = this way
you can easier count if indentation level is right There must only be
the title with one # images are included as documented in our
notation.md file of the lecture notes Do not use the words previous and next, as the images can float and previous and next makes ABSOLUTELY NO
SENSE when referring to images if you do not know the final format
where the images will be placed which is the case for us. Figures must
be mentioned in the text explicitly. e.g. as shown in `@fig:figlabel`
you can use pandoc locally to make sure bibs and figures show up
corretcly.

## pull request in documents from commandline
I updated a section in the github section called

“25.5.17 Contributing to the Document”

The problem is neither the TAs or I can test it as our permissions are
different. Would someone with github knowledge be so kind to test that
section and improve so others can replicate this?

It may actually work, but I have not tested it. Improvement suggestions are welcome.

There is lots of documentation about this on the github.com web page also,


If you are forking a repo, it's better to keep your master branch
clean. Meaning that there won't be any changes done on your master
branch itself. It will be the branch that you sync with the upstream
repo (the cloudmesh repo).



Hence, if you are doing any changes, it's better to do it in a branch
in your own repo. Then if there are conflicts, you can resolve them on
your own repo first when rebasing (syncing your dev branch with the
upstream master).

Ex:

Let's say you are working on the file ref.bib.

You are keeping the master of your repo in sync and working on a branch called dev-ref. But when you try to push, you finds out that there's already a new change in the upstream master for the same file.



Then what you do is, first sync your master. Then you do a rebase for your branch to get the branch up to date with the latest changes (your synced master). Once rebased (fixing the conflicts), then you can send the pull request from your branch to the upstream repo.


It's always better to keep your master clean for the rebase to be easier on your fork.

## pyenv installed but can not find python
We recommend that you read the section that comes immediately after the pyenv install section. It comments on how to install python with pyenv. pyenv by itself does not come with python, it is a tool to install python. Yo naturally have to install the version you want to use.

## ssh add/keychoain on OSX
There is lots of information in the lecture notes on SSH I strongly recommend you read it. However, I saw some people struggle with SSH keychain on OSX. Here some tips on how to make it work on OSX which I found on the Web.



1. Start the ssh-agent in the background.
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Agent pid 59566
```

2. Use `~/.ssh/config` file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain. Add the following to the file:
```
Host *
 AddKeysToAgent yes
 UseKeychain yes
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file. Note the -K is OSX specific and means you will use keychain to manage your key
```
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## check into github early!


There is no such thing as to check your things in github early. In
fact that is good as than others can contribute early including me if
I have time. A good example is the vagrant code where a student made
the wise decision to check it in and someone (in this case me)
contributed. As you can see through teamwork we can achieve a lot.

So do not be embarrassed if your code needs to have improvements



In the cm folder when you work on things just create an incoming
directory and put your code in a subfolder if it is not yet
integrated. We will set up a library structure soon.



I just spoke to a student who thought his code was not yet good
enough. But my oppinion is any code is good enough. as it allows
others to contribute early


## I want to start my project now.

We have provided you with a concrete assignment of developing a python program. This program, can be used as part of you project. I advise you that if you like to start on your project now. TO start with the development of this program. We will enhance this program so that the project can benefit from it.

You should spend your time learning about python and setting up your environment. Using VirtualBox will come in handy when we start managing virtual machines from the command line.


## Mac with external hard drive

Apologies if this is explained in the book but I'm not very familiar with this, would using a macbook Air with an external 1TB hard drive been sufficient computing power/memory for this course or do I need to look into memory chips?

yes. typically you do not need an external HD if you have space left. Naturally if your Mac book is 10 years old there are limitations. Certainly you can login into the cloud and use cloud resources from your mac. We even had student s that successfully conducted the class with a $35 Raspberry pi.We know that chroembook, cell phone and tablet is not good enough.

## Submitting a section

Do you want us to email or post here to let you know when we've created a section and a pull request for it? And do we need to check with you that no one else is doing that section before we write and submit it?

we wtch the pull requests actively in github, when you have a section taht is not yet in git hub add them and put in the comment you work on it,


## Where to post comprehensions?
Where would you like us to post comprehensions? Will there be a thread for each comprehension or should we be making our own posts for each?

a) When students have questions and others answer that counts as comprehension.

b) Once we have set up the github repos you can post comprehension code you like to share with others there

c) Residential students will have opportunity to also participate actively in the class.

d) there will be a notebook.md in which you can document your activities. That however willl not be set up till Friday when the deadline for the survey is passed.

## Communication of sections into the README.yml
see: https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/sp19-516-122 as example

MAKE SURE YOU USE EXACTLY THE SAME SPACING AND DASHES AND ATTRIBUTES

Look at it in raw, only copy from the raw file, never from the rendered version

## Question on adding new sections to the book and github protocol
I was interested in adding the following item below to the book in the data center section "6.4 Data Center Characteristics" as another bullet example of AWS failures that have occurred:
https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2017/03/02/aws-outage-that-broke-the-internet-caused-by-mistyped-command/

I am new to github, what is the protocol to obtain a local copy of the book, update, then submit my change?

The easiest iv the markdown file eixsts is to locate it in github via the Web browser and edit it in the browser.

Make the modification and create a pull request. We talked about this in the online and residential hours this week.

You can setup an online help with a TA to have them show you.

## Where to post references
Is there a particular bib file we should be adding to for our references or should we be creating a new one for the sections/chapters we do?

first identify if the bib not already exists.

if not simplui add a new bibfile with the topic and add it there.

## where are the lectures?
We got the first question that a student could not find the lectures, but had already access to piazza. In a previous post we send out a ling to the epub. This epub is also linked in the Resources panel in piazza. You need to download and open this ePub.

As explained in that post on piazza you will need to install an ePub reader. On OSX this is installed by default and called iBooks or Books. On Windows you need to install a new version of Microsoft Edge and open the epub for it or alternatively use caliber. On linux you need to install calibre.

Every reasonable OS has working ePub readers ... if its not installed, please install one. We can discuss issues also live on Thursday if needed. Residential students can discuss issues on Friday morning in our first meeting.

The ePub contains a detailed set of information on how to take the class You need to read it., It also contains a section Proposed Lecture Timeline. I suggest you look at the first two entries in that table.
