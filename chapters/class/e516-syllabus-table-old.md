      like to do a Raspberry PI project or do not have a computer
      order a Raspberry PI.

    * Week Sep 3

      Read: Definition of Clouds; find alternative definitions on the
      internet; set up accounts on google, github; get hid directory;
      start READNE.md, notebook.md; Read: Python, do some python
      programming; understand classes

    * Week Sep 10

      Read: docopts and experiment; Read Data Center section and
      contribute to that section; complete setup of your class
      computer; use pyenv

      learn about swagger; Experiment with swagger code gen

    * Week Sep 24 and Oct 1

      Read about Virtual machines; Start a VM on a cloud of your

      Tip: pick an area you can contribute, use libcloud to interface
      with your cloud that you have chosen. Remember you do not have
      to do all the clouds at this time, you can each week from now
      work with a different cloud if you like. It is
      recommended that you try programming with libcloud! To prepare
      yourself for the project.

      NIST OpenAPI framework for a computer inventory. Identify
      adbatages and disadvanteges opf using GraphQL. When are ther
      instances that GraphQL does not work well (Tip: compare to
