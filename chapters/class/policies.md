# Course Policies

We describe briefly some class policies.

## Discussion via Piazza

1. All communication is done in Piazza. It is an IU approved
   communication tool and superior to CANVAS discussion list
2. CANVAS is only used with students that are not in Piazza. The only
   messages they will get is to activate Piazza and use the class
   Piazza
3. You are allowed to use whatever calendar system you like.
4. We will not use CANVAS calendar, however you can manage that
   yourself. CANVASS allows you to add events such as assignment
   deadlines.
5. Piazza is FERPA compliant <https://piazza.com/legal/ferpa>


## Managing Your Own Calendar

From time to time we get the question from a very small number of
students why we are not using or uploading the assignment deadlines and
the assignment descriptions to CANVAS. The reason for this is manifold.
First, our class has different deadlines for different students within
the same class. This is not supported by CANVAS and if we would use
CANVAS leads to confusion and clearly shows the limitation of CANVAS.
Second, we are teaching cloud computing. CANVAS is not a tool that you
likely will use after graduating. Thus we are providing you the ability
to explore industry standard tools such as github to maintaining your
own tasks and deadlines, while for example using github issues (see the
section about github). We highly recommend that you explore this as part
of this class and you will see that managing the assignments in github
is **superior** to CANVAS. Naturally you can not make that assessment if
you are not trying it. Thus we like you to do so and it is part of any
assignment in your class to use github issues to manage your assignments
for this class.

However, if you still want to manage your tasks in CANVAS, you can do
so. CANVAS allows you to create custom events, so if you see an
assignment in piazza or the handbook, you are more than welcome to add
that task yourself to your own CANVAS tasks. As we have only a very
small number of assignments this will not pose a problem either for
graduate or undergraduate. Being able to organize your deadlines and
assignment with industry accepted tools is part of your general learning
experience at IU.

Obviously, this makes it also possible to use any other task or calendar
system that you may use such as google calendar, jira, microsoft
project, and others.

As you can see through this strategy we provide the most flexible system
for any student of the class, while giving each student the ability to
chose the system they prefer for managing their assignment deadlines. It
is obvious that this strategy is superior to CANVAS as it is much more
general.

Online and Office Hours
-----------------------

To support you we have established an open policy of sharing information
not only as part of the class material, but also as part of how we
conduct support. We establish the following principals:

* in case of doubt how to communicate address this early in class and
  attend online hours;

* all office hours if not of personal nature are open office hours
  meaning that any student in class can be joined by other students of
  the class and all meeting times are posted publicly. This includes
  in person office hours with TAs. Other students are allowed to
  listen in and participate.

* it is in your responsibility to attend in person classes and online
  hours as we found that those that do get better grades. For
  residential students participation in the residential classes may be
  mandatory. International students may need to check university
  policies.

* instructors of this class will attempt within reason to find
  suitable times for you to attend an online hour in case you are an
  online student.

### Office Hour Calendar

Online Students:

* Online hours are prioritized for online students, residential
  students should attend the residential meetings.

Residential Students:

* Residential students participate in the official meeting times. If
  additional times are required, they have to be done by appointment.
  Office hours will be announced publicly. All technical office hours
  are public and can be attended by any student. Online hours are not
  an excuse not to come to the residential class.

  However Residential students can in addition to the residential
  class use the online student meeting times. However, in that case
  online students will be served first. It is probably good to check
  into the zoom meeting and identify if the TA has time. They will be
  in zoom.

Meeting times and phone numbers are posted in your piazza in the
`Resources` section

Class Material
--------------

As the class material will evolve during the semester it is obvious that
some content will be improved and material will be added. This benefits
everyone. To stay up to date, please, revisit this document on weekly
basis. This is practice in any class.

HID
---

You will be assigned an hid (Homework IDentifier) which allows us to
easily communicate with you and does allow us to not use your university
ID to communicate with you.

You will receive the HID within the first couple of weeks of the semester by the
TA's.

Class Directory
---------------

You will get a class directory on github.com and not the iu
github. For that reason you will be asked to give us a github id so
we can create a openly accessible directory for you in which you can
collaborate with the students of this class. The directories are only
used to store the artifacts of the class. As all artifacts are
supposed to be open source github.com  provides us with the service
that millions of professionals and researchers use for their work.

Notebook
--------

All students are required to maintain a *class notebook* in github in
which they summarize their weekly activities for this course in bullet
form. This includes a self maintained list of which lecture material
they viewed and what they worked on in each week of the class.

The notebook is maintained in the class github.com in your hid project
folder. It is a file called `notebook.md` that uses markdown as
format. Notebooks are expected to be set up as soon as the git
repository was created.

You will be responsible to set up and maintain the `notebook.md` and
update it accordingly. We suggest that you prepare sections such as:
Logistic, Theory, Practice, Writing and put in bullet form what you have
done into these sections during the week. We can see from the github
logs when you changed the notebook.md file to monitor progress. The
management of the notebook will be part of your discussion grade.

The format of the notebook is very simple markdown format and must
follow these rules:

- use headings with the # character and have a space after the #
  Use `# Week X: mm/dd/yyyy - mm/dd/yyyy` as the subject line for
  each week

- use bullets in each topic.

- Do not refer to section numbers form the ePub in your notebook
  as they can change. Instead use the section name or headline and
  possibly a URL. When using URLS in md format they must be enclosed in
  `<>` or `[text](URL)`

Please examine carefully the sample note book is available at:

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sample/blob/master/notebook.md>

The notebook.md is not a blog and should only contain a summary of what
you have done.


Blog
----

You can maintain your own optional blog. However, the blog will not be
used for grading. Do not include sensitive information in either the
blog or the notebook. A blog is not a replacement for the notebook. If
something does not go so well, do not focus on the negative things,
but focus on how that experience can be overcome and how you turn it
to a positive experience. Be positive in general.


Waitlist
--------

The waitlist contains students that are unable to enroll in a section of
a course. Students choose to add themselves to the waitlist. They are
not automatically added, but choose to do so intentionally based on the
status of the course. There are two reasons for students to be on the
waitlist. The first, and primary, reason is that the class is already at
the scheduled, maximum capacity. Since there are no seats available, the
student can elect to add themselves to the waitlist. The second reason
is that the students' own schedule has a time conflict. This occurs when
they are trying to enroll in a class that overlaps with the time of a
class they are already enrolled in.

Students are moved from the waitlist to the regular section during a
daily batch process, and not in real time. The process is not in
realtime because the registrar receives many requests to increase
capacity, decrease capacity, and change rooms. If the process were real
time there would be a catastrophe of conflicts.

Students are moved from the waitlist in chronological order that they
added themselves to the waitlist. If you are still on the waitlist there
are no spaces free, the batch process has not run for the day, or the
student in question has a schedule conflict.

Faculty are not able to selectively choose students from the waitlist.

How long does the waitlist process stay active?: The automated
processing of the waitlist ends on Thursday of the first week of class
At this time the waitlist will no longer be processed. As the
residential class starts on Friday, this may cause issues. Either talk
to the department on Thursday or show up on Friday. Most likely there
will be spaces left. Students on the waitlist at that time will remain
on the waitlist, but remain there until the student decides to change
their registration. Students may not do that, because they get assessed
a change schedule fee.

Students tell me they still want to enroll after the first week of
classes. How do they do this?

Beginning Monday, after the first week of class students begin to use
the eAdd process to do a late addition of the course. The request is
routed to the professor of record on an eDoc and the faculty will be
notified via email. Faculty can deny or approve based on whatever
criteria they wish to apply. If the faculty member approves, the eDoc is
electronically forwarded to the Academic Operations office and we will
approve the late add **if the room capacity** allows the addition,
otherwise we must deny the addition because of fire marshal regulations.
Many times, there are seats in a classroom/discussion/lab, but because
other students have not *officially* dropped, enrollment is still at
capacity.

After everything, a student that was unable to enroll in the class
attended all year and completed all course work as if they had enrolled.
Can the student get credit and can I give the student a grade?

Yes. There is a provision for a late registration - contact our office
if this occurs. Students will be assessed a tuition fee at the time of
late or retroactive registration.

Registration
------------

The Executive Associate Dean for Academic Affairs requires starting
Spring 2018 that students that are not officially enrolled, can not
register at the end of the class if they in-officially took the class.
Please make sure that within the first month you have enrolled. If we do
not see in CANVAS, you are not in the class. In case you are on a
waitlist it is your responsibility to work with the administration after
the waitlist is over to be added to the class by getting permission from
the School.

Auditing the class
------------------

We no longer allow students to audit the class because:

* Seating in the lecture room is limited and we want foster students
  that enroll full time first.

* The best way to take the class is to conduct a project. As this can
  not be achieved without taking the class full time and as auditing
  the class does not provide the full value of the class, e.g. not
  more than 10% of the class. Hence, we do not think it is useful to
  audit the class.

* Accounts and services have to be set up and require considerable
  resources that are not accessible to students that audit the class.

Resource restrictions
---------------------

* It is not allowed to use our services we offer as part of the class
  for profit (e.g. just enrolling in the class to use our clouds).

* In case of abuse of available compute time on our clouds the student
  is aware that we will terminate the computer account on our clouds
  and the student may have to conduct the project on a public cloud or
  his own computer under own cost. There will be no guarantee that
  cloud services we offer will be available after the semester is
  over. Projects can be conducted as part of the class that do not
  require access to the cloud.

Incomplete
----------

Incompletes have to be explicitly requested in piazza through a private
mail to *instructors*. All incompletes have to be filed by DATE TO BE ANNOUNCED.

Incomplete's will receive a fractional Grade reduction: `A` will become
`A-`, `A-` will become `B+`, and so forth. There is enough time in the course
to complete all assignments without getting an incomplete.

Why do we have such a policy? As we teach state-of-the-art software this
software is subject to change, not only within the course, but also
after the course. As we may offer some services and only have access to
the TA's during the semester it is obvious that we like all class
projects and homework assignments to be completed within a semester.
Services that were offered during the semester may no longer be
available after the semester is over and could adversely effect your
planing. It will be in the students responsibility to identify such
services and provide alternatives if they become unavailable. We try
hard to avoid this but we can not guarantee it.

Furthermore, once an incomplete is requested, you will have 10 month to
complete it. We will need 2 month to grade. No grading will be conducted
over breaks including the summer. This may effect those that require student
loans. Please plan ahead and avoid an incomplete.

The incomplete request needs to be off the following format in piazza:

    Subject:
        INCOMPLETE REQUEST: HID000: Lastname, Firstname

    Body:
        Firstname: TBD
        Lastname: TBD
        HID: TBD
        Semester: TBD
        Course: TBD
        Online: yes/no

        URL notebook: TBD
        URL assignment1:
        URL assignment2: TBD
        ....
        URL paper1: TBD
        URL project: TBD

        URL other1: TBD

Please make sure that the links are clickable in piazza. Also as
classes have different assignments, make sure to include whatever is
relevant for that class and add the appropriate artifacts.

In case of an incomplete you may be asked to do additional assignments
and assignments that have been adapted based on experience from the
class. Please note also that we could reject an assignment if it is
identified to no longer reflect the state-of-the-art. All previously
submitted assignments such as papers, sections, and so on will be
reviewed on this criterion. For example, let us assume you developed a
tutorial on technology visit version x. Let us assume that since you
completed this task a version x+1 comes out. It will be your
obligation to update the deliverable. This is also true if the
tutorial has been graded previously. The incomplete and the change of
the software have at this time negated the originally assigned grade.
In most cases the changes may be small. In other cases the changes
could be substantial. Hence avoid an incomplete.

Here is the process for how to deal with incompletes at IU are
documented:
