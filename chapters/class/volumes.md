# Example Artifacts

## Technology Summaries

We are maintaining a large list of technologies related to clouds and Big Data at 

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/technologies>

This repository generates the following epub

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/technologies/blob/master/vonLaszewski-cloud-echnologies.epub>

Students that have to contribute as part of their class Technology summaries are asked to produce meaningful, advertisement free summaries of the technology and indicate in some cases if not obvious show they relate to cloud or big data. The length of such summaries is about 300 words. 

## Chapters

Previously we asked students to write a 2 page paper on a topic related to bigdata analytics or cloud technologies (dependent on the course). Example papers are listed bellow

* Use Cases in Big Data Software and Analytics Vol. 1, Gregor von Laszewski, Fall 2017,
<http://cyberaide.org/papers/vonLaszewski-i523-v1.pdf>

* Use Cases in Big Data Software and Analytics Vol. 2, Gregor von Laszewski, Fall 2017,
<http://cyberaide.org/papers/vonLaszewski-i523-v2.pdf>

* Big Data Software Vol 1., Gregor von Laszewski, Spring 2017, <https://github.com/cloudmesh/sp17-i524/blob/master/paper1/proceedings.pdf>

* Big Data Software Vol 2., Gregor von Laszewski, Spring 2017, <https://github.com/cloudmesh/sp17-i524/blob/master/paper2/proceedings.pdf>

*   Vol 8, Gregor von Laszewski, Spring 2018, <http://cyberaide.org/papers/vonLaszewski-cloud-vol-8.pdf>

This has however resulted in a large number of duplicated material especially in the introductions and motivations. Thus we like this year to have you more focused on the topic and do not write a large introduction on what big data or cloud computing is. Therefore we renamed the 2 paper to a chapter, while you could assume certain things that have already been taught to you and you do not have to repeat it.

## Project Reports

The goal of the class is to use open source technology to also write your technical reports. As a beneficial side product, we are able to distribute all previous reports from students to you. In your reports you will be doing a similar report, but will not use the same topic, without a significant improvement from a report already delivered in that area. 
For big data we have more than 1000 data sets we point to. I am sure you can do a unique project. For engineering cloud there are recently so many new technologies that there is not much chance of an overlap. TA's will review your project proposal, but it is your responsibility to make sure they are unique.

Please note that we do not make any quality assumptions to the published papers. It is up to you to identify outstanding papers.
