# Example Artifacts


---

![](images/learning.png) **Learning Objectives**

* Identify what other students have done previously.
* Look at previous chapters, which are collected as technology reviews.
* Look at previous project reports.
* Looking at the documents provides you with an initial overview of
  the scope for the artifacts.

---

As part of this class you will be delivering some artifacts that are
being graded. Some of them include writing a *chapter* that can be
contributed to the class lecture and a project. To showcase you some
[example artifacts]{.index} take a closer look at the documents listed
in this section. Please also note that you can not duplicate or
replicate a students previous work without significant improvements.
All material listed here is available online, including all source
code.

## Technology Summaries

We are maintaining a large list of [technologies]{.index} related to clouds and Big Data at

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/technologies>

This repository generates the following epub

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/technologies/blob/master/vonLaszewski-cloud-technologies.epub>

Students that have to contribute as part of their class Technology
summaries are asked to produce meaningful, advertisement free
summaries of the technology and indicate in some cases if not obvious
show they relate to cloud or big data. The length of such summaries is
about 300 words. Students of E516 do not have to contribute to this
and will instead focus on programming. Students of I423, I523 and
other sections must contribute to it and will get an assignment
related to it. We post here the existence of this document also for
516 students. They can voluntarily improve or add sections if they
like which will go into their discussion credit.

Please use the following indicators to mark the progress of summaries that you are working on.

![Smiley](images/smile.png) ready for review

![Construction](images/construction.png) selected by student so others do not select it and we know what is worked on

The signs are put as follows. You can view an example at <https://github.com/cloudmesh/technologies/blob/master/chapters/tech/bioconductor.md>

## Chapters

Previously we asked students to write a [2 page paper]{.index} on a topic
related to bigdata analytics or cloud technologies (dependent on the
course). Example papers are listed bellow

* Use Cases in Big Data Software and Analytics Vol. 1, Gregor von Laszewski, Fall 2017,
<http://cyberaide.org/papers/vonLaszewski-i523-v1.pdf>

* Use Cases in Big Data Software and Analytics Vol. 2, Gregor von Laszewski, Fall 2017,
<http://cyberaide.org/papers/vonLaszewski-i523-v2.pdf>

* Big Data Software Vol 1., Gregor von Laszewski, Spring 2017, <https://github.com/cloudmesh/sp17-i524/blob/master/paper1/proceedings.pdf>

* Big Data Software Vol 2., Gregor von Laszewski, Spring 2017, <https://github.com/cloudmesh/sp17-i524/blob/master/paper2/proceedings.pdf>

*   Vol 8, Gregor von Laszewski, Spring 2018, <http://cyberaide.org/papers/vonLaszewski-cloud-vol-8.pdf>

This has however resulted in a large number of duplicated material
especially in the introductions and motivations. Thus we like this
year to have you more focused on the topic and do not write a large
introduction on what big data or cloud computing is. Therefore we
renamed the 2 paper to a chapter, while you could assume certain
things that have already been taught to you and you do not have to
repeat it.

## Project Reports

The goal of the class is to use open source technology to also write
your technical reports. As a beneficial side product, we are able to
distribute all previous reports from students to you. In your reports
you will be doing a similar report, but will not use the same topic,
without a significant improvement from a report already delivered in
that area. For big data we have more than 1000 data sets we point to.
I am sure you can do a unique [project]{.index}. For engineering cloud there are
recently so many new technologies that there is not much chance of an
overlap. TA's will review your project proposal, but it is your
responsibility to make sure they are unique.

Please note that we do not make any quality assumptions to the
published papers. It is up to you to identify outstanding papers.
