# Definition of Cloud Computing

---

**:mortar_board: Learning Outcome**

* Compare different definitions of cloud computing.
* Review the History of cloud computing.
* Identify trends.
* The current hot job is *data engineer* which is sought after more than data scientists (a new trend). You have chosen the right course ::-):

We are looking at some of the definitions of cloud computing and
trends in the following presentation.


* [:clapper: Definition of Cloud Computing](https://youtu.be/2ifRjHbJWK8)

This includes the following 

## Defining the term Cloud Computing

In this presentation we review three definitions of cloud
computing. This includes the definitions by 

* NIST
* Wikipedia
* Gartner

## History and Trends

We review some of the historical aspects that lead to cloud computing
and especially look into more recent trends. These trends motivate
that we need to look at enhancements to the traditional  Service Model
that include Infrastructure-, Platform- and Software- as a Service.
These enhancements especially are targeting Function-, and Container
as a Service.

## Job as a Data Engineer

We look at some job related trends that especially focus on the newest
hot job description called **Data Engineer**. It is motivated that
current job offerings as data engineer is 13% versus 1% for data
scientists. As this class is targeted towards bringing the engineering
component towards the data scientists, computer scientists, and
application developer, This class is ideally suited for increasing
your marketability. 

## You must be that TALLL

We close this class with Gregor’s TALLL principle to succeed in Cloud
Computing:


You must be that TALLL to survive in Cloud Computing and Big Data 

This principle includes the following characteristics

Trend Awareness (TA)

: We need to be aware not only what is currently a trend, but what will be future trends

Longevity Planning (L)

: We need to be able to reproduce our services and results (e.g. can we reproduce them still in six month).  

Leap Detection (L)

: We need to be able to deal with technology Leaps

Rapid evolution (L)

: We notice that in our field technology changes take place almost every 6 month

Learning Willingness (L)

: We need to constantly learn to keep up as technology changes every 6 month

Naturally this principal can be applied to other disciplines.
