Grading
=======

Grading for homework will be done within reasonable time of the
submission if the submission was on time. This however could still take
multiple weeks. Students that miss the deadline will be graded on best
effort, which could mean at the end of the semester as TAs will grade
first papers that have been handed in on time. A fractional grade reduction
will be given for residential students if the project is late (e.g. A
becomes A- and so on). Some
homework can not be delivered late (which will be clearly marked and 0
points will be given if late; these are mostly related to setting up
your account and communicating to us your account names such as
Assignment 0.)

It is the student's responsibility to upload submissions well ahead of
the deadline to avoid last minute problems with network connectivity,
browser crashes, cloud issues, etc. It is a very good idea to make early
submissions and then upload updates as the deadline approaches; we will
grade the last submission received before the deadline. To allow TAs
to monitor your progress we require a weekly checkin. 

Note that the assignments in this class will take a considerable
amount of time and doing proper time management is a must for this
class. Avoid starting your project late. Procrastination does not pay
off. Starting a paper a day or even in the week before the deadline will
allow you not to achieve your best. Late Projects or term papers will
receive a 10% grade reduction.

If we see it necessary additional assignments will be added. Instead
of tests the assignments have build in checks for you understanding
the topics. 

Grades on Canvas
----------------

**The final grade for your class is NOT accurately posted in CANVAS.
Please visit the registrar for your final grade.**

We have run many times into issues with CANVAS thus we try to stay as
much as possible away form it. We know that the total grade will not
be accurately reported in CANVAS. Thus please do not contact us check
your grade in the registrar.

CANVAS has also the tendency to give the students a wrong sense of
security as all non graded assignments are not included into the grade
calculation on CANVAS. THis again, your grade will be wrongly
reported by CANVAS.

Furthermore we are using only a letter grading scheme that distinguishes
qualitatively between grades. Typically we do not engage in arguing if
you get a point more or less. Instead we look at the artifact and decide
if it is an A or A- and so on. CANVAS on the other hand uses a point
system that may provide a misleading information as we do not use
points.

Once the due date is passed all incomplete assignments will appear as an
*F* in CANVAS. Once we receive and review the submission this grade will
be changed. Please, do not contact us if you submitted late and you see
an F in CANVAS temporarily.

In case you get an incomplete for that class, all grades in CANVAS
stay as F. You will need to look at the registrar grade

Discussion about Grades
-----------------------

Should it be necessary a discussion about a grade must not be taking
place via e-mail nor via piazza. You must use a private post but post it to the instructors only.
