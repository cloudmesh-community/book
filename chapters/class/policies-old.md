## Course Policies

We describe briefly how we manage different classes and how to interact
with us.

### Class Material

As the class material will **evolve** during the semester it is obvious
that some content will be improved and material will be added. This
benefits all classes. To stay up to date, please, revisit this document
on weekly basis, as as we will adapt content based on your feedback.


### Communication in Piazza and not CANVAS

In the past we have found numerous limitations to CANVAS that makes it
*not possible* for us to use it effectively for our classes. Such
limitations were not overcome even after consulting our professional
course support team at IU while spending days and weeks trying to fix
the issues we encountered. From the professional staff we have been
given the advice to avoid using CANVAS and use a better approach that we
outline as follows:

*   we use CANVAS notifications only for the initial class setup and
    notify you how to gain access to **piazza** where all class
    discussions take place;
*   any discussion about grades is however only done in CANVAS;
*   we will **delete** all e-mail send to us on personal or IU e-mail
    addresses. All discussions need to take place either in private or
    in public posts on piazza (other than grades which need to be send
    via CANVAS as the previous point explained);
*   TA's are strictly **forbidden** to answer any e-mail that is not send
    via piazza. Their answers will only be posted within piazza;
*   any post to piazza to a TA must not be send to the individual TA but
    to *instructors*;
*   any post from piazza by a TA must be not be send to the individual
    student only, but also must include *instructors*;

These elementary rules guarantee that multiple instructors can view
your post and that a record of the post is created in piazza.


### Managing Your Own Calendar

From time to time we get the question why we are not using or
uploading the assignment deadlines and the assignment descriptions to
CANVAS. The reason for this is manifold. First, our class has
**different deadlines for different students** within the same
class. This is not supported by CANVAS and if we would use CANVAS it
leads to confusion. Second, we are teaching cloud computing. **CANVAS
is not a tool that you likely will use after graduating.** Thus we are
providing you the ability to explore industry standard tools such as
**github** to maintaining your own tasks and deadlines. This can be
achieved by using github issues. In fact in some classes you will be
**required to use github** and you will be graded on its efficient
use. You will see that managing the assignments in github is
**superior** to CANVAS. Naturally, you can not make that assessment if
you are not trying it. Thus one of the mandatory assignments is that
you use github for all course deliverable.

However, if you still want to manage your tasks in CANVAS, you can do
so. CANVAS allows you to create custom events, so if you see an
assignment, you are more than welcome to add that task yourself to your
own CANVAS task list. As we have only a very small number of assignments
this will not pose a problem to you. As we do not require you to use
CANVAS for managing your tasks, it also allows you to use any other task
or calendar system that you may use such as google calendar, jira,
microsoft project, and others.

As you can see through this strategy we provide the **most flexible
system for any student of the class**, while giving each student the
ability to chose the system they prefer for managing their assignment
deadlines. It is obvious that this strategy is **superior** to CANVAS
as it is much more general and once you graduate the knowledge you
gained using professional tools such as github tools will help you and
give you an advantage.

### Office Hours

We provide office hours for residential and online
students. Residential students should primarily use the discussion
session.


#### Online Students

To support you we have established an open policy of sharing
information not only as part of the class material and your
deliverable, but also as part of how we conduct support. We establish
the following principals:

* Online hours are prioritized for online students, residential
  students should attend the residential meetings.
* In case of doubt how to communicate address this early in class and
  attend online hours.
* All office hours if not of personal nature are open office hours
  meaning that any student in class can be joined by other students of
  the class and all meeting times are posted publicly.
* It is in your responsibility to attend in person classes and online
  hours as we found that those that do, get better grades. For
  residential students participation in the residential classes is
  mandatory due to the same reason.
* Instructors of this class will attempt within reason to find
  suitable times for you to attend an online hour in case you are an
  online student.
* We suggest that you let the TA's know in piazza before you come to
  an online hour, in order to make sure they are at the office.


The  online support hours are as follows:

:warning: The time bellow are not determined yet and we will attempt to
provide hours via a poll. The hours bellow are form last semesters class

-   TBD Mon 6:00pm-7:00pm, 7:00pm-8:00pm, Gregor
-   TBD Tue 7:00pm-8:00pm, TA
-   TBD Wed 7:00pm-8:00pm TA
-   TBD Thu 8:00pm-9:00pm TA
-   TBD Fri 7:00pm-8:00pm TA
-   TBD Sat 10:00am-11:00am TA
-   TBD Sun 10:00am-11:00am TA

If a meeting is needed with Gregor, this is done upon appointment and
times Tue-Thu 10am - 2:00pm are possible. However, TA's will figure out
if a meeting is needed. Please prepare your technical questions ahead of
time, and place them in Piazza first. TA's and the class will try to
answer them if possible

The link for joining the meeting on Zoom is posted in Piazza in the
*Resources* section for your class.


#### Residential Students

Residential students must attend the class listed in the discussion
time (see information provided by the registrar) and ask any question
during that time. Missing the discussion time will result in grade
reduction. It will be your responsibility to find out what you missed
in case you could not attend. Trust us it is better if you plan to
attend as you are hit twice, once by you getting a grade reduction and
once by us noticing that those that do not attend do not as well in
class.

*   Residential students participate in the official meeting times. If
    additional times are required, they have to be done by appointment.
    Office hours will be announced publicly. All technical office hours
    are public and can be attended by any student.
*   Online hours are not an excuse not to come to the residential class.
*   Residential students can in addition to the residential
    class use the online student meeting times. However, in that case
    online students will be served first. It is probably good to check
    into the zoom meeting and identify if the TA has time. They will be
    in zoom.

### HID

You will be assigned an hid (Homework IDentifier) which allows us to
easily communicate with you and doe allow us to **not use your
university ID** to communicate with you. You will receive the HID
within the first week of the semester by the TA's.

### Activity Notebook

All students are **required** to maintain a *class activity notebook*
in github.  Students will summarize their weekly activities for this
course in bullet form. This includes a self maintained list of which
lecture material they viewed.

The notebook is maintained in your class github.com repository in your
hid project folder (you will establish thi sin the first week of
class). It is a file called notebook.md that uses *markdown* as
format.  While using markdown, you can either edit it locally and upload to
github, or directly edit it via the git hub Web editor. 

You will be responsible to set up and maintaining the notebook.md and
update it accordingly. We suggest that you prepare sections such as:
Logistic, Theory, Practice, Writing and put in bullet form what you have
done into these sections during the week. We can see from the github
logs when you changed the notebook.md file to monitor progress. **The
management of the notebook will be part of your discussion grade**.

The format of the notebook is very simple and must follow these rules:

-   use headings with the # character and have a space after the #
-   use bullets in each topic.
-   each bullet **must** have an individual date that is of the form
    yyyy/mm/dd. Please do not lump bullet points under s single date.
    Have each bullet point its own date
-   if you have done the activity in a period than add the second date
    to it yyyy/mm/dd - yyyy/mm/dd
-   If you refer to section numbers in your notebook, please also add
    the section title as the section numbers may change in case we need
    to add content

Please examine carefully the sample note book is available at:

-   <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sample/blob/master/notebook.md>

The notebook.md is not a blog and should only contain a summary of what
you have done in bullet form. PLease also note that you will only get
credit for the notebook on a weekly basis. So if you do not do anything
in class for that week you still need to add this in that week. As
this only takes 30 seconds (we timed it) excuses such as *I did not
have time* do not apply. TAs will use the gitlog to determine if you
updated your notebook on weekly basis.


### Blog

Naturally you can maintain your own blog, but it is optional. If you
like to maintain your own blog, you can create yourself also as a blog.md
file in your github repository. However do not include sensitive
information in there. As pointed out **a blog is
not a replacement for the notebook**. The blog will not be used for
grading. If something does not go so well, do not focus on the negative
things, but focus on how that experience can be overcome and how you
turn it to a positive experience.


### Incomplete

Incomplete's have to be explicitly requested in piazza through a private
mail to *instructors*. 

Incomplete's will receive **two fractional grade reductions**: A will become
B+, A- will become B, and so forth. There is enough time in the course
to complete all assignments without getting an incomplete.

In case you take multiple classes and our class is the only class that
you have an incomplete in, it shows to us that you did not spend
sufficient time for the class and instead favored another class. In
this case we will reduce the grade not only by 2 fractions, but you
will receive a **full grade reduction**. E.g. an A becomes a B, a B
becomes a C and so on.

Why do we have such a policy? As we teach state-of-the-art software
this software is subject to change, not only while you take the course
but more importantly when the course is completed and you have no
access to TAs and the services (as they are only available during the
time you took the class).  It will be in the students responsibility
to identify alternative services if they become unavailable. We try
hard to avoid this but we can not guarantee it.

Furthermore, once an incomplete is requested, you will have **10 month** to
complete it. We will need **2 month to grade**. No grading will be conducted
over breaks. This may effect those that require student loans. Please
plan ahead.

The incomplete request needs to be off the following format in piazza:

    Subject: 
        HID-FA18-000: INCOMPLETE REQUEST: Lastname, Firstname

    Body:
        Firstname: TBD
        Lastname: TBD
        HID: TBD
        Semester: TBD
        Course: TBD
        Online: yes/no

        URL notebook: TBD

        URL technology-1: TBD
        URL technology-2: TBD
        URL technology-3: TBD
        URL technology-4: TBD
        URL technology-5: TBD
        URL technology-6: TBD
        URL technology-7: TBD
        URL technology-8: TBD
        URL technology-9: TBD
        URL technology-10: TBD
        

        URL prg assignment: TBD

        URL paper: TBD

        URL project: TBD

        URL other: TBD

Please make sure that the links are clickable in piazza. Also as
classes have different assignments, make sure to include whatever is
relevant for that class and add the appropriate URLs to artifacts into
the class github.com

Here is the process for how to deal with incomplets at IU:

* <http://registrar.indiana.edu/grades/grade-values/grade-of-incomplete.shtml>

Once you have been granted an incomplete assignments or projects that
may have already been graded, but become out dated have to be
redone. In most cases this may effect any assignment of your class.
This is one more reason to avoid an incomplete.



### Waitlist

The waitlist contains students that are unable to enroll in a section of
a course. Students choose to add themselves to the waitlist. They are
not automatically added, but choose to do so intentionally based on the
status of the course. There are two reasons for students to be on the
waitlist. The first, and primary, reason is that the class is already at
the scheduled, maximum capacity. Since there are no seats available, the
student can elect to add themselves to the waitlist. The second reason
is that the students' own schedule has a time conflict. This occurs when
they are trying to enroll in a class that overlaps with the time of a
class they are already enrolled in.

Students are moved from the waitlist to the regular section during a
daily batch process, and not in real time. The process is not in
realtime because the registrar receives many requests to increase
capacity, decrease capacity, and change rooms. If the process were real
time there would be a catastrophe of conflicts.

Students are moved from the waitlist in chronological order that they
added themselves to the waitlist. If you are still on the waitlist there
are no spaces free, the batch process has not run for the day, or the
student in question has a schedule conflict.

Faculty are not able to selectively choose students from the waitlist.

How long does the waitlist process stay active?: The automated
processing of the waitlist ends on Thursday of the first week of class
At this time the waitlist will no longer be processed. As the
residential class starts on Friday, this may cause issues. Either talk
to the department on Thursday or show up on Friday. Most likely there
will be spaces left. Students on the waitlist at that time will remain
on the waitlist, but remain there until the student decides to change
their registration. Students may not do that, because they get assessed
a change schedule fee.

Students tell me they still want to enroll after the first week of
classes. How do they do this?

Beginning Monday, after the first week of class students begin to use
the eAdd process to do a late addition of the course. The request is
routed to the professor of record on an eDoc and the faculty will be
notified via email. Faculty can deny or approve based on whatever
criteria they wish to apply. If the faculty member approves, the eDoc is
electronically forwarded to the Academic Operations office and we will
approve the late add **if the room capacity** allows the addition,
otherwise we must deny the addition because of fire marshal regulations.
Many times, there are seats in a classroom/discussion/lab, but because
other students have not *officially* dropped, enrollment is still at
capacity.

After everything, a student that was unable to enroll in the class
attended all year and completed all course work as if they had enrolled.
Can the student get credit and can I give the student a grade?

Yes. There is a provision for a late registration - contact our office
if this occurs. Students will be assessed a tuition fee at the time of
late or retroactive registration.

### Registration

The Executive Associate Dean for Academic Affairs requires that
students that are not officially enrolled, **can not register at the
end of the class** if they in-officially took the class.  Please make
sure that within the first month you have enrolled. If we do not see
you in CANVAS, you are not in the class. In case you are on a waitlist
it is your responsibility to work with the administration after the
waitlist is over to be added to the class by getting permission from
the School.

### Auditing the class

We no longer allow students to audit. The motivation to not offer
these classes for auditing are:

*   Seating in the lecture room is limited and we want to foster students
    that enroll full time first.
*   The best way to take the class is to conduct a project. As this can
    not be achieved without taking the class full time and as auditing
    the class does not provides only 10% of the entire class it is not
    useful to audit the class.
*   Accounts and services have to be set up and require considerable
    resources that are not accessible to students that audit the class.

### Resource restrictions

It is not allowed to use our services for profit (e.g. just enrolling
in the class to use our clouds).

In case of abuse of available compute time on our clouds the student
is aware that we will terminate the computer account on our clouds and
the student may have to conduct the project on a public cloud or his
own computer under own cost. There will be no guarantee that cloud
services we offer will be available after the semester is
over. Projects can be conducted as part of the class that do not
require access to the cloud.

### Plagiarism

In the first week of class you will need to read the information about
plagiarism. In order to avoid issues with plagiarism we require you to
take the following straight forward test during the first 2 weeks of
class

* <https://www.indiana.edu/~academy/firstPrinciples/certificationTests/index.html>

This is needed as we found that some students do have an incomplete
understanding of this topic and as the major deliverables do require a
solid understanding of this topic. If you have taken that test before
you do not have to retake it.

If we find cheating or plagiarism, your assignment will be receiving
an *F*. This especially includes copying text without proper
attribution.  Furthermore, we will follow IU policy and **report your
case to the dean of students** who may elect to expel you form the
university in severe cases. Please understand that it is **your
doing** and the instructors have no choice as to **follow university
policies**. Thus, please do not blame the instructors for **your
actions**. As you have to take the certification excuses such as "I do
not know what plagiarism is", "I forgot to include the original
reference as I ran out of time", do obviously not apply.  This applies
to all material prepared for class including assignments, exercises,
code, tutorials, papers, and projects. If there is no time, do not
submit and instead of an "F" ask for an incomplete or extension with
possible grade reduction. In fact if you know you have plagiarized, do
not even have us review your paper. Do not work on teh assumption
*they will not find out*. Please note that our test for plagiarism is
more sophisticated than any online service that we are aware of this
includes turnitin.com. This includes text written in different
languages.

For more information on this topic please see:

* <https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/student-conduct/misconduct-charges/academic-misconduct.shtml>

### Teamwork

In most cases we allow all assignments to be done in teams of up to
three team members but not more. However, please confirm with the
instructor as he may cahnge this. Im portant in case of team work is
that a team doe not just hand in a project that would be normally done
by one student. It is obvious that all team members must equally
contribute and make sure the deliverables are multiplied by the number
of people in the project.  It will be up to you to determine a team,
but we recommend that you chose wisely. Naturally if a team member
does not contribute to the project you need to address this early on.
Please do not come to us a week before the deadline is due and say a
team member has not contributed, this is far to late to do any
adjustment to the team. It is in your responsibility to manage the
team.  You can build different teams throughout the semester for
different tasks. Please communicate clearly and timely with your class
mates. We have unfortunately very often seen the issue that a team has
not read the handbook and instead of delivering a superior project or
document the quality was poor as the both team members did not work
and assumed the other one would do the work for them naturally it is a
disastrous plan to have others work for you and instead do little
work while delegating your tasks and overburden your team members.
