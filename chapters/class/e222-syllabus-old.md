### Week 3. REST for Cloud computing

We will be starting the class with introducing you to REST services that provide a foundation for
setting up services in the cloud and to interact with these services. As part of this class we will be
revisiting the REST services and use them to deploy them on a cloud as well as develop our own
AI based rest services in the second half of the class.
To get you started you need to read the following sections:
An introduction to rest is provided in Section 34. It also provides a video recording of the material
that was presented in class.

#### Overview of REST

Next, we present you with information on how to easily create a rest service with FlaskRESTFUL
a library that makes the creation of web services in python using an object oriented approach
easy. A Lab was held that introduced you to developing such a service

#### Flask RESTful Services

A number of contributions from students have since been made including the development effort
for this lab. Links to this work can be found at

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sp18-505/tree/master/rest>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sp18-409/tree/master/rest>

Next, we introduced you to Python Eve which ia a framework that allows you to define rest services
with schemas. This is important as it first allows you to easily define them while having just to do a
very minimal set of programming. Second, it allows you via Eve to make sure you define a well
designed data model that you can communicate to the users of the REST service.

#### Rest Services with Eve 418

In the Lab that may spawn multiple weeks you will be developing a Flask or Eve rest service. The
REST service retrieves information form your computer and exposes it to the client. You can chose
what you like to present, but we want that all students in class do a different information. TAs are
working with you which information you expose. A detailed Assignment is posted and coordinated
in piazza about this. YOu will be writing two services. One that uses flask features, the other one
that uses a database schema using Eve. The entire class can openly collaborate with each other on
this task. The code is to be checked in into your github repository. Information of interrest include
memory available of the computer, cpu type and so on. This is not read from a text file but life
queried.

TODO: Tyler:Describe how each student gets a unique assignment. Coordinate that assignment.
The link to the assignment in piazza is given next, directions for each student will come out the week of
February 4, 2018.


* https://piazza.com/class/jc9dcfnbi045kv?cid=27

#### Weeks 2-3. Setting up your development environment

It is important that you have a development environment to conduct the class assignments. We
recommend that you use virtual box and use ubuntu. We have provided an extensive set of material
for you to achieve this. Please consult additional resources form the Web
The material includes:

:o2: Tyler: please include links to the sections

* Install virtual box
* Install ubuntu on the virtual box
* Virtual Box Week 2 243
* Install an editor to develop python programs. We recommend pyCharm or simply emacs.
* Basic Emacs Weeks 2-3 201
* Using pyenv for multi version python installs
* Managing Multiple Python Versions with Pyenv Weeks 2-3 301

Technologies covered: piazza, git, pycharm, virtualbox, pyenv, python

Exercise: Continue to work on REST service.

#### Week 5. Introduction to simple Containers

We will be providing an introduction to containers and container technologies. Exercises will
include to run the REST services that we developed earlier to start in containers and utilize them.

* Motivation - Microservices
* Motivation - Serverless Computing

#### Week 6. Introduction to Container Clusters

We will be providing you with an introduction on how to not use one server, but multiple servers
to run containers on. This includes docker swarm, kubernetes, (maybe mesos if time allows).
Exercises include the deployment of minikube that enables you to run kubernetes on your computers.
Alternatively access to a docker swarm cluster may be provided.

* Docker Released Feb 11, 2018 459
* Docker and Kubernetes Released Feb 11, 2018 460

(we will not do kubernetes, this time)

#### Week 7. Map Reduce

In this section we will introduce you to the concept of Map reduce. We will discuss systems such
as Hadoop and Spark and how they differ. You will be deploying via a container hadoop on your
machine and use it to gain hands on experience.
part/syllabus.tex


#### Week 8. Overview of Cloud Services

We will be introducing you how to use Cloud services offered via a number of Cloud providers.
Topics covered include: overview of AWS, overview of Openstack, libcloud, and boto

#### Week 9. Multi cloud environments

We will teach you how to create a multi cloud shell while leveraging an abstract programming
interface to easily switch between multiple clouds. You can practically participate in helping to
develop interfaces to AWS, Azure, and OpenStack. As you have also worked with containers, you
can develop such interfaces also for containers including frameworks such as kubernetes. We will
be using libcloud to simplify the abstraction.

#### Week 10. Cloud Data and Applications

We will cover a number of Application examples for Cloud computing. In the second part we will
focus on Cloud Data Services and how we access data on the cloud. Exercises will include moving
data between data services. THis includes your own computer, box and google which both are
offered at IU.

#### Other weeks

All exercises in these weeks will develop REST services that expose machine leraning algorithms
as service. Data will be either passed along directly through parameters to the call, or on case of
large data a URL to the data source. The lessons from the previous weeks will be helping you to
achieve this. It is not sufficient to just run the algorithms, but you must be integrating them into a
REST service.
Other weeks are not yet included here but will cover Artificial Intelligence.

####\ Assignments

All assignments are summarized in the Section :o2: but are posted earlier in piazza.com in the pinned
section.

Students need only to do one project. The project is conducted thought the entire semester.

* Example chapters are indicated with ![Github](images/github.png)

* Dates may change as the semester evolves

* The project is a long term assignment (and are ideally worked on
  weekly by residential students). It is the major part of the course
  grade.

* Sections and chapters prepare you for documenting a technical aspect
  related to cloud computing. It is a preparation for a document that
  explains how to execute your project in a reproducible manner to
  others.

* Additional lectures will be added that allow easy management of the
  project.  These lectures can be taken any time when needed.

## Assessment

This course is focusing on the principal "Learning by Doing" which is
assessed by simple graded and non-graded activities. The assessment
may include comprehension of the material taught, programming
assignments, participation in online discussion forums, or the
contribution of additional material to the class showcasing your
comprehension.

The comprehension is also measured by the development of a chapter and
sections in markdown that can be distributed and replicated to other
students. This is done in preparation for the project that must
include a simple deployment and runtime instruction set.

The main deliverable of the class is a project. The project is
assessed through the following artifacts:

1. Deployment and install instructions,
2. Project report (typically 2-3 pages per month, tutorial and
   chapters can be reused if possible),
3. Working project code that can be installed and executed in
   reproducible manner by a third party
4. Code developed by the project team distributed in github.com
5. Project progress notes checked into github throughout the semester. Each
   week the project progress is reported and will be integrated
   into the final grade.
6. Discussions or progress reports with the instructors can be conducted on
   online and residential class hours.

The grade distribution is as follows

* 10% Comprehension Activities
* 10% Sections
* 10% Chapter
* 70% Project

As the project is the main deliverable of the course it is obvious
that those starting a week before the deadline will not succeed in
this class. The project will take a significant amount of time and
fosters the principal of "Learning by Doing" at all stages throughout
the semester.

The class will not have a regular midterm, but it is expected that you
have worked on your project and can provide a snapshot of the progress
outlining the goals of the project and how you will achieve these
goals till the end of the semester.

The final Project is due 3 weeks before the semester ends. Issues with
your project ought to have been discussed before this deadline with
the TA's The TAs will in the next 3 weeks go over the projects and
evaluate mayor and minor issues that you may be able to fix without
penalty. Larger changes will receive a grade penalty. The last fix
(upon approval) possible will be 2 weeks before semester end without
penalty. It is recommended that you are available till the last day of
class.

## Incomplete

Please see the university regulations for getting an incomplete.
However, as this class uses state-of-the-art technology that changes
frequently, you must expect that an incomplete may result in
significant additional work on your behalf as your project may need
significant updates on infrastructure, technology, or even programming
models used. It is best to complete the course within one semester.

## Other classes I423, I523, I524, B649, E516, E616 (ok)

IU offers other undergraduate classes in this topic area such as I423. If you are interested in taking it,
please see when they are taught.  Additional graduate level classes related which can also be taken
only by special permission including:

* CSCI B-649 Cloud Computing is the same as E516 but for computer science students.
* I524 is the same as E516 but for Data Engineering Students
* E516 Introdcustion to CLoud COmputing and CLoud Engeneering

All of these classes are project based and require a significant and consistent effort of time on your side.
