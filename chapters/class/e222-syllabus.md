## Incomplete

Please see the university regulations for getting an incomplete.
However, as this class uses state-of-the-art technology that changes
frequently, you must expect that an incomplete may result in
significant additional work on your behalf as your project may need
significant updates on infrastructure, technology, or even programming
models used. It is best to complete the course within one semester.

## Other classes I423, I523, I524, B649, E516, E616 (ok)

IU offers other undergraduate classes in this topic area such as I423. If you are interested in taking it, 
please see when they are taught.  Additional graduate level classes related which can also be taken  
only by special permission including:

* CSCI B-649 Cloud Computing is the same as E516 but for computer science students.
* I524 is the same as E516 but for Data Engineering Students
* E516 Introdcustion to CLoud COmputing and CLoud Engeneering

All of these classes are project based and require a significant and consistent effort of time on your side.

### How to take this class

This class is an undergraduate class that contains two sections that
you must attend.

In this document we will introduce you theoretically to some concepts
that are important for this class. This is done either through
lectures, written material, or pointers to Web resources. You are
responsible to

1. listen to the online lectures and understand them.
2. identify additional material that may help you in understanding the
    lectures. This could include additional resources on the internet
3. Contribute to the material by correcting errors and updates you may
    find.

Please note that we try to keep the material up to date with your
help. However, in our field software and documentation changes quickly
and if you identify updated material we expect that you help us fixing
it. You will get credit doing so.

To allow you to be most flexible in taking this class, we certainly
allow you to work ahead. Thus you can use all but the in person
lectures ahead of time. The Syllabus will clearly identify which
material is available.  Note that the book may include sections that
are not marked in the syllabus. You do not have to read such sections.

Please note that this class does not have *small* assignments and any
assignment is likely to take you a significant amount of time. Thus it
is advisable that you start your assignments early and make sure you
do not do them in the last week before the assignment is due. This
contrasts other undergraduate classes, that may focus on the
assignment of a number of toy exerises. Instead we will work
throughout the entire semester towards a project you will conduct.
In order to make it earlier for you,  we will
introduce graded checkpoints of all large assignments. The grades for
these checkpoints are final and can not be improved by work done
later. Also here please be advised that some may take several weeks to
conduct and it is your responsibility to devote enough time to these activities.

To asure progress, you will have to manage a
notebook.md file in your github directory (that we will create for
you) in which you will update your weekly progress. If you miss a
lecture, it is in your responsibility to inform yourself what was
being taught. Attendance and participation will be graded as well as
the update to notebook.md will be graded.

In the following calendar we put in the last day of the week 
when the assignments are typically due

## Covered Topics


As part of this class you will have to explore the following
topics. These topics are either included in this document, or we are
pointing you within this document to other documents with the
information.

If we forgot anything let us know. The order of the lectures and the
lecture material are subject to change as we see fit.

---

:warning: *This weekly Agenda will be updated every week. Yo are required to
check in every week for updates. At this time we have included an
approximate weekly agenda.*

To see if checkins succeed you can look at:

* <https://circleci.com/gh/cloudmesh-community/book>

Currently, the topics covered in the class include the following.

### Week 1. Overview of this Class

We will provide an overview of this class.

*Logistic:* Get familiar with the class structure. 
   
*Read:* Preface; Class Overview; Start reviewing your python knowledge
   
*Assignment Accounts:* Find a computer you can do the class
programming on (tablet and chrombook will not suffice).  Get an
account on piazza.com with your @iu.edu name Get an account on
github.com (This is NOT the IU github) and apply there for a github
username. Post the username into a form that will be send to
you. Make sure that the account you send us is your github.com
account. This is a graded assignment that must be completed in the
first week of class

This must be completed in the first week by Friday. (Survey will be
posted on Piazza).

*Assignment notebook:* Once you get your github directory, update the
file `notebook.md`. Mind the spelling notebook is lowercase. Use
simple markdown bullet lists to record your activities.
   
*Assignment Development Environment:* (Multiweek assignment, to be
completed in the firts month) It is important that you have a
development environment to conduct the class assignments. We
recommend that you use virtual box and use ubuntu. We have provided
an extensive set of material for you to achieve this in this
document.  Please consult additional resources form the Web and
utilize the Lab hours.


### Week 1 and 2. Review of Python for Intelligent Systems Engineering 

* Theory: basic Python Language
* Theory: pyenv, setup.py, modules
* Practice: Living without anaconda

* Python specific topics include:
  
  * Assignment: Install Python and use it throughut the semester
  * Why not anaconda?
  * Using python 3.7
  * pyenv
  * pip
  * Language
  * Numpy :+1:
  * Scipy :+1:
  * OpenCV :+1:
  * ScikitLearn :+1:

  
  *Report:* Create an empty report based on our template in
  github. The TAs may do this with you in the Lab.
  
  *Github Pull Requests*: Find a spelling error in the class material
  and create a pull request to correct it.

### Week 2. Review of Linux shell for OSX, Linux, and Windows

* Theory: Basic Linux Shell
* Practice: SSH :+1:
* Assignment: ssh key generation on your computer, upload to github.com

### Week 3. Introduction to REST

* Theory: Overview of REST, Eve, OpenAPI
* Practice: develop a REST service with OpenAPI

*Theory:* Learn about REST services and use Swagger OpenAPI to
create a rest service that returns the CPU information about your
computer

We will be starting the class with introducing you to REST services
that provide a foundation for setting up services in the cloud and
to interact with these services. As part of this class we will be
revisiting the REST services and use them to deploy them on a cloud
as well as develop our own AI based rest services in the second half
of the class.

Focus on OpenAPI example posted in the NIST github repository

* *Project team:* Build a project team with no more than 3
  people. There will not be an exception.  You are allowed to work
  alone. Make sure your project team does the work together.  E.g. YOu
  must not have 3 people on the team and the project could have been
  executed by a single person. In case of more than one person the sum
  of the deliverables must be larger than what one team member can
  achieve. It is an advantage to work in a team as you can check each
  other.
  
  If a team member does not contribute to the project, the team has
  the right to exclude the non working team member with consultation
  of the instructors. We will have a joint meeting with the team to
  identify the best path forward. Chose your team members wisely.
  Ideally you should make this decision in the first 3 weeks.


### Week 4. Introduction to Scientific Writing

* Theory: Scientific writing with markdown and bibtex
* Practice: Contribute a significant chapter to the book (as a group)
* Practice: Project Report (as a group)
* Practice: Introduction to Emacs
* Practice: Introduction to jabref

See the separet ePub for more information:
[Link](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/vonLaszewski-writing-markdown.epub?raw=true)

*Assignment Scientific Writing:* Learn about markdown. See our class
notes and internet resources.  Note that we use pandoc markdown
that may not render properly in github, especially when it comes to
figure captions, references, and bibliography. (You have till the
end of the month). Install and use jabref. 

*Report:* Learn bibtex and create references in report.bib that you
 use in report.md. Make sure that you do only one report per team and
 update your README.yml file accordingly. Check in the Lab with the
 TAs if you have done it correct.

* *Project Idea due:* A one page formal document that summarizes the
  project.  This is not a proposal. The workds *I* and *project*,
 *report* must not be used.  It is essentially a snapshot of your
  final report. Discuss with the TAs in the Lab how to define a
  project. 
  
  *Github:* make sure your team mates have access to your project
   directory.
