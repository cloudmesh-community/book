## Lecture Material

A new version of the following books have been released:

* [e516 Lecture Notes Engineering Cloud Computing, Gregor von Laszewski, Ed. 2019](https://laszewski.github.io/book/e516/) [@las19e516]
* [Cloud Computing, Gregor von Laszewski, Ed. 2019](https://laszewski.github.io/book/cloud/) [@las19cloudcomputing]

Please read the chapter in the book [Cloud Computing](https://laszewski.github.io/book/cloud/) [@las19cloudcomputing]
about GraphQL and Messaging.





We have spend significant time to teach you how to generate REST
services from OpenAPI specifications. This has the advantage that you do
not have to develop a server as it can be outomatically generated from
the OpenAPI specification. 

Furthermore clients could be developed with Swagger codeGen in the
supported large number of supported programming languages. However using
Swagger codeGen is not required for this class and goes bejond the scope
we like you to explore as part of this class. So if you are using
Swagger code gen, you need to contact Gregor to identify why you would
need this for this class. In general it is not needed.

Instead we like to focus on two different technologies. One is called
GraphQl and the other is called MQTT.

The information about them are included in the book:
