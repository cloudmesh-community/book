You can find the link to the recordings in the Weekly lecture notes that
are published as epub or pdf. 

## Can I search in the ePub reader?

Yes, consult the help in your epub reader

## I could not find an answer to an assignment?

In some cases it will take you a considerable effort to research the
answer. An example is the Datacenter question about energy consumption
or cost. It is not expected that google may return a result. Yoo may need
to consider other publications such as google scholar, or professional
journals. If you after some hour you have not found an answer, maybe the
answer there exists not such information. Check waht other students have
done and ask them how they found the information. Remember this class is
a community.

## How much time do I need to spend for each question?

This question can not be answered as it depends on the question. Some
questions may take hours. The tital time students typically spend on
this class is 6 hours. However, sometimes it may be less or more
dependent on your background. please be reminded that this class is
attended by many students with a lot of different background. For
example if we ask you to do some python programming, and you have no
background in python that taske may take you longer than someone who has
python background. However after you have done some python tasks the
next python task will be easier. Let us assume you do not know python,
but it took you only 1 hour to do the assignments for teh week, we
recommend that you do the rest of the time to learn python. THis way
when the python assignment starts you are a python expert also.

## I do not understand Piazza?

Atetnd the online hours and ask questions there or watch the recorded
online meetings as we explained it there also.
