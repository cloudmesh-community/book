### Receive your HID

You will receive an HID from us that identifies you for class purposes.
Please do not send us ever your university ID as we never use it. We
only use your firstname, lastname, class, and semester to identify you,
never the IU id. Once you have an HID we typically use that.

### README.yaml

Once you have created your github.com account and filled out the Account
form (see last weeks assignments), we will set up a GitHub repository
for you. Please place the following `README.yaml` into your repository,
while replacing the name and firstname with your name and the hid with
the hid we provide to you. The community is either 516 or 649. Please
note that the hid starts with `hid-`:

```
---
owner:
  firstname: Gregor
  lastname: von Laszewski
  hid: hid-000
  community: 516
  semester: fa19
```

### Plagiarism Certificate

When writing contributions that can be integrated into the class
material, it is important that it is not plagiarized. Contributions in
thsi class will be automatically identifieable as part of the github
mechanism showcasing which document was produced by whom.
 
However, it is most important that you not just copy content from Web
pages, but make appropriate modifications and provide credit to where you
found this information.

As you certainly will have learned form other classes what plagiarizm is
and how not to plagiarize you will probably be fine. However, we often
find one or two studnets in a class that do not know what it is. Therefore
we *STRONGLY RECOMMEND** that you take the plagiarizm certificate
offered by IU. This has the advantage that you can show it in other
classes and show you are informed. Please also read the code of conduct
rules at IU.
 
For this reason we included this material also in part in the Book

* Scientific Writing with Markdown

Please read the chapter about Plagiarizm.

Please be aware that we may conduct superior plagiarizm tests on your
contributions. Our tests are even better than  "Turn-it-in" while we are
able to identified "translations" from other languages, copies of text
from non-public external university servers, and compnay archives that
turn it in does not check. IU has a zero tollerance policy that we must
follow. Plagiarizm/cheating could lead to expulsion from the university.
The argument *I did not know what plagiarizm is* does not count
according to IU rules. You must know what it is prior to you taking a
course at IU.
 
It is not subject of this class to teach you what plagiarizm is. We do
this just to remind you to avoid any uncertainty about it.
