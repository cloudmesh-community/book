# Week 2: Cloud Data Centers

## Lecture Material

A new version of the following books have been released:

* [e516 Lecture Notes Engineering Cloud Computing, Gregor von Laszewski, Ed. 2019](https://laszewski.github.io/book/516/)[@las19e516]:
* [Cloud Computing, Gregor von Laszewski, Ed. 2019](https://laszewski.github.io/book/cloud/)[@las19cloudcomputing]:

Please read the section in [Cloud Computing](https://laszewski.github.io/book/cloud/)[@las19cloudcomputing]:
about **Data Centers**. We decided not to do a video as the material
in this section frequently changes and videos became too quickly
outdated. 

Do the following assignments:

* E.Datacenter.2.a
* E.Datacenter.2.b
* E.Datacenter.3
* E.Datacenter.4
* E.Datacenter.5
* E.Datacenter.8

Optional:

* E.Datacenter.9

## Lab Activities

* Make sure you have completed the application for the chameleon cloud 
  as we will use that in our lab soon.
  
* Make sure you have Python set up. Read up on virtualized python
 environments as used in python 3.7.4. Its super simple. Understand
 what the command

 ```bash
 $ cd ~ 
 $ python -m venv ENV3
 $ source ENV3/bin/activate
 ```
 
 Those using Windows, please find out ho to do it on Windows, provide a
 document venv-windows.md in your HID directory describing it.
 
 Those using conda/anaconda, please find out ho to do it with
 conda/anaconda, provide a document venv-conda.md in your HID directory
 describing it.
 
 Make sure you create a separate venv for this class called ENV3 that we
 will use for this class and should not be used for other classes as we
 do not want to create side effects. Please also be aware that at times
 it may be necessary to delete your python environment in case you do
 something wrong and it would be unwise to combine all your python
 activities into one python install.
 
 You will not receive any points for just installing python, without
 being able to create a virtualized python deployment.
 
 Our Python book and the internet will help. This feature is build into
 Python 3! so it is super easy to use.


### Receive your HID

Make sure you have received an HID on github. Look it up at 

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community>

Make sure to accept the github invitation and try add a file. You can
use either the GUI way with *Create new File* or if you are familiar
with github use the command line tools. Next week we will introduce you
to convenient tools so you can develop your programs more easily in
github.

### README.yml

Make sure the information in your README.yaml file is accurate. Make
sure to change the value in community and use your class number. This
will be either 516 or 649. Please note whan we ask you for your hid
number it is the entire hid number not just the last three digits.

### Optional: Plagiarism Certificate

When writing contributions that can be integrated into the class
material, it is important that it is not plagiarized. It is most
important that you not just copy content from Web pages, but make
appropriate modifications and provide credit to where you found this
information.

As you certainly will have learned form other classes what plagiarism is
and how not to plagiarize you will probably be fine. However, we often
find one or two studnets in a class that do not know what it is. Therefore
we **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** that you take the plagiarism certificate
offered by IU. This has the advantage that you can show it in other
classes and show you are informed. Please also read the code of conduct
rules at IU.
 
For this reason we included this material also in part in the Book

* Scientific Writing with Markdown

Please read the chapter about Plagiarism.

Please be aware that we may conduct superior plagiarism tests. Our tests
are even better than  "Turn-it-in" while we are able to identified
"translations" from other languages, copies of text from non-public
external university servers, and company archives that turn-it-in does
not check. IU has a strict policy that we must follow.
Plagiarism/cheating could lead to expulsion from the university. The
argument *I did not know what plagiarism is* does not count according to
IU rules. You must know what it is prior to you taking a course at IU.
 
It is not subject of this class to teach you what plagiarism is. We do
this just to remind you to avoid any uncertainty about it.
