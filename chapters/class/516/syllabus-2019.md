## Instructor

* Gregor von Laszewski <laszewski@gmail.com>
* Office hours: By appointment


## Audience

* We recommend you know one programming language.
* Knowledge of Python is of advantage but not required. Python is easy.

## Course summary

This class will introduce you to state-of-the-art cloud computing
concepts an engineering approaches. This will include virtual machines,
containers and Map/Reduce. The course will have a Lab in which you can
practically explore these concepts. You will, for example, have the option
to create a cloud as part of this course and explore cloud computing tools
and frameworks.


## References

The course does not have a required commercial book. However, we will extensively relate to online material. This also includes:

* [Cloud Computing](https://laszewski.github.io/book/cloud/)
* [Linux](https://laszewski.github.io/book/linux/)
* [Python](https://laszewski.github.io/book/python/)
* [Markdown](https://laszewski.github.io/book/writing/)

We will select topics from these books but also include material that
is or may not be covered in these books. The books are evolving during
the semester.

## Tools

You will be required to have a computer to log into the cloud. We will
give you access to an OpenStack cloud.  Access to Azure, AWS, Google
and others can be achieved through their free tier,

## Attendance

Attendance accounts for 10% of your final grade. If you need to skip
class for any reason, you need to notify the instructor and TAs


## Assignments

This course will not have exams. Instead, we have the following graded
assignment categories:

* Lab Assignments (pass/fail) are assignments that will be
  conducted on a regular basis. They will help you making sure you
  not only understand the material theoretically but try them out.

* Cloud Technology Review and Examples (Graded): (This can be
  substituted for more programming in your project). This is a document
  about a Cloud technology that is not yet included in our handbook to
  introduce an interested party to it. It should not contain
  advertisements but be a rational description of the technology with
  examples that you have tried yourself. You will have to give a non
  plagiarized presentation and document about it.

* Project Assignments (Graded): The most important part of the class for
  which you will be working on throughout the semester. Up to three students can work on a project. In the case of group projects, the project
  deliverables are increased.

The project has three submissions that are spread throughout the
semester. Each submission builds on the previous one and modifies
previous documents into a consistent project report and documentation
for your project.

* Project Outline

  A description of what your project is about and how it
  relates to cloud computing and address:

  * What is the problem you try to address?
  * What are you doing to address this problem?
  * How are you addressing this problem?
  * What is the architecture that addresses the problem that you will 
    implement?

* Code and Documentation Review

  * You will be asked to have a meeting with the TA's and/or instructor
    to showcase your code and have at least one review prior to your
    final submission.

  * This will take usually take place through the Lab hours on regular 
    basis.
  * A first project discussion must have been done at least once at 
    midterm time.

* Final Project Submission

  * All code and documentation must be checked into GitHub well before
    the semester is over. This allows us to give you feedback for
    improvements.

Please note that the syllabus is subject to change. Students in this
class often come from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. As
such, the instructor reserves the right to change the content of the
course to accommodate the needs and expectations of the students.

## Grade Breakdown

* 70% Project
* 10% Chapter
* 10% Assignments
* 10% Particpation

There is no exam or midterm in this class. However, there will be a
project review at midterm time.

## Statement on Academic Misconduct

Students will be expected to uphold and maintain academic and
professional honesty and integrity as outlined in the Code of Student
Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct. Cases of academic misconduct will
be handled according to the student disciplinary procedures described in
IU's policies.
