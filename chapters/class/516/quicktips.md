# Quick Tips

## Requirements

We recommend that you know one programming language. Although most
activities are done in Python, this programming language does not have
to be Python as it can easily be learned throughout the semester. No
background in cloud computing is needed.

## Time Commitment

Any class at an university requires a significant time commitment. Due
to the different background the students have it is difficult to predict
the actual time needed. On average we see that students spend 6 hours on
the class if they do participate on a weekly basis. Students with little
programming experience spend up to 12 hours.

## Course Material List

Course material will be distributed as ePubs, PDF, Video or
Presentations. However you will be required to research some topics on
the on the internet as Cloud Computing ia arapidly evolving field and we
find the most up to date information on the Web.  We also ask you
to help us updating the ePub and to use additional resources as
appropriate.

The list includes:

* [Cloud Computing](https://laszewski.github.io/book/cloud/)[@las19cloudcomputing]
* Cloud Technologies, Gregor von Laszewski [@las19technologies]
* Project Report Format, Gregor von Laszewski [@e516-report-sample]
* Introduction to Python [@las19python]
* Linux for Cloud Computing [@las19linux]
* Scientific Writing with Markdown [@las19writing]

## Help

If you take our class, please use piazza to ask for help. This is
important as questions may be answered by different Teaching Assistents
(TAs) based on expertise. Please, do not send e-mail to the instructors.
TAs are not allowed to answer e-mail send to them personally.

## How to Take this Class

This class is attended by students with greatly different backgrounds
and time schedules. To be most flexible and adress all students there
are two different ways on how you can take this class.

* Way 1: *Free form.* Here you simply look at the Syllabus table for the
  semester and identify whatever section you feel like reading (when it
  becomes available). However, make sure you conduct our weekly **Lab
  activities**.

* Way 2: *Chronological order.* The lecture notes are ordered
  chronological. Thus you can follow our lecture alos in chronological
  order.

Please note that we have set aside a recommended set of weekly Lab
activities. The activities are pass-fail and will be integrated in your
grade. You are certainly allowed to work ahead, but please be aware that
based on feedback and observation we may make modifications to the Labs.

Typically,  Lab activities are supposed to be completed within one week
as it alerts us of problems you might have that we can than address.
This assures us that we know you will have no issues with your project.

Lab activities will not receive any credit if you are a residential
student and the activity has not been completed within one week.
However, residential students  will get two **Delay a Lab for One
Week** passes that you can apply to any of the Labs and still get credit.

If you are an online student we recommend that you finish the Labs also
in one week. However, you will get eight **Delay a Lab for One
Week** passes that you can apply to any of the Labs.

Please note that if you would need to postone a lab for two weeks, you
need to use two passes. Lab passes expire one month before the last day
of class. You will have to complete all labs by that time. No credit
will be given at that time if this deadline is missed for any delayed
Labs as TAs must focus their attention on project support.

Lab passes do not apply to other assignments and due dates.



## Assignments

Besides the Lab's, we have only two main assignments in this class.
The Lab's will prepare you towards achieving these assignments.

### Technology Review

> *Students doing projects related to cloudmesh are exempt from writing
> a technology review, but are expected to do more programming and making
> sure the project has a manual and proper documentation.*


As part of cloud engineering you will be exposed to a large set of
technologies. To sharpen your skills in analyzing and evaluating these
technologies, you will be asked to prepare a technology review that is
being added to a class proceedings.

This includes a substantial non-plagiarized document that can be added as a
chapter to the lecture notes. The review must be done on a topic that is
not yet included in our book. The review will not include advertisement
statements form those that have developed the technology, but will
qualitatively describe the technology and potentially contrast it to
other related technologies. In addition you will have to develop an
example showcasing how to use the technology. The minimal length of a
review is about 800 words.

An example for such a section is 

* GraphQL in the Cloud Computing book

Alternatively you can prepare several different smaller sections (at
least 5) that may not have an example in it but are more of descriptive
nature. Sample sections contributed by students include:

   * Section Microsoft Nafik Data Center in the Datacenter Chapter
   * Section Lambda Expressions in *Introduction to Python*


> ![Warning](images/warning.png) *It is expected from you that you self identify a section
> yourself, as this shows competence in the area of cloud
> computing. If however you do not know what to select, you must attend
> an online hour with us in which we identify a topic with
> you. Technologies that are not repeatable due
> to enormous cost or licensing issues need to get prior
> approval.*



### Project

The objective of the project is to define a clear problem statement
and create a framework to address that problem as it relates to cloud
computing.

A project is the major activity that you chose as part of your class.
This includes a project report* or *manual* and working project code.
You will create a significant non-trivial project related to cloud
computing and cloud engineering. Up to three students can collaborate. The
project could be built on top of a previous project but must have
significant additions or modifications. If a previous project is used, a
detailed discussion is to be held on what has been improved and is different.

In this class it is especially important to address the reproducibility
of the deployment. A test and benchmark, possibly including a
*downloadable* dataset, must be used to verify the correctness of your
approach.


#### License

All projects are developed under an open source license, such as the
Apache 2.0 License. You will be required to add a LICENCE.txt file and
describe how other software, if used, can be reused in your project. If
your project uses different licenses, please add a README.md file that
describes which packages are used and what licenses these packages have.

#### Project Report

A project report is to be delivered and continuously improved throughout
the semester in GitHub. It includes not just the analysis of a topic,
but a short description of the Architecture and code, with
**benchmarks** and demonstrated use. Obviously it is longer than a term
paper and includes descriptions about reproducibility of the
application. A README.md is provided that describes how others can
reproduce your project and run it. Remember that tables and figures do
not count towards the paper length. The following minimal length is
required:

*  800 words, one student in the project
* 1200 words, two students in the project
* 1400 words, three students in the project

Projects with more students are expected to do more programming. The
report is written in markdown and checked into GitHub.  The report will
be made available in a class proceedings. A Report could be substituted
by a manual and benchmarks. In this case a one page extended abstract
has to be written, that includes the ling to the manual.

For certain projects, the requirement of a report can be waved or is
significantly reduced while replacing it with more programming
activities. This includes

* Any project that enhances cloudmesh
* Building a large cloud cluster with Raspberry Pi's
* Any Application project showcasing NIST big data reference architecture
  use (there is a hard deadline of the NIST project by Dec 1st).

However you still have to do a manual and usage examples, benchmarks and
`pytest`s for them.


#### Project Code

You are expected to deliver a **documented** and **reproducible** code
with unit tests that allows a TA to replicate the project with ease. In
case you use vm or container images, they must be created from **scratch
locally** and may not be uploaded to services such as DockerHub. You
can, however, reuse approved vendor uploaded images such as from ubuntu
or centos or other linux distributions. All code, scripts, and
documentation must be uploaded to github.com under the class specific
GitHub directory.

#### Project Data

Data is to be hosted on IU's Google drive, if needed. If you have larger
data, it should be downloaded from the internet. It is your
responsibility to develop a download program. The data **must** not be
stored in GitHub. You are expected to write a python program that
downloads the data either from the Web or IU's data storage.

#### Work Breakdown

This is an appendix to the document that describes in a bullet list who
did what in the project. If you are a team of one such a section is not
needed. This section comes after the references. It does not count
towards the page length of the document. It must includes explicit URLs
to the git history that documents the statistics to demonstrate more
than one student has worked on the project. If you can not provide such
a statistic or all check-ins have been made by a single student, the
project has shown that they have not properly used git. Thus, points
will be deducted from the project. Furthermore, if we detect that a
student has not contributed to a project, we may invite the student to
give a detailed oral presentation of the project including a
demonstration of the examples in real time.

#### Bibliography

All bibliography has to be provided in a BibTex file that **must**
either be validated with **jabref** or with **emacs**. Please be advised
doing references correctly takes some time so you want to do this early
and throughout the semester. What would take less than 5 minutes a week,
could quickly add up to multiple hours at the end of the semester.
Please note that exports of Endnote or other bibliography management
tools do not lead to properly formatted bibtex files, despite their
claims of doing so. You will have to clean them up and we recommend to
do it the other way around. Hence, the easiest way to manage your
bibliography is with *jabref* or *emacs*. Make sure **labels** only include
characters from [a-zA-Z0-9-]. Use dashes and not underscore and colons
(`_` ,`:`) in the label. Your labels must be meaningful and unique. We
will deduct points if you submit an invalid *BibTex* file to GitHub. So
please make sure your file is validated. You can even create your own
checks with tools such as `biber`.

We will teach you what to do it is easy.

#### Reproducibility

In general, any project must be deployable by the TA. If it takes hours
to deploy your project, please talk to us before final
submission. This should not be the case. Also, if it takes 100 steps,
we are sure you can automate them ... as you are likely doing something
wrong or have not thought about cloud computing where we tend to
automate most of the steps.

You have plenty of time to execute a wonderful project but you need to
work consistently on it. Starting one week before the deadline will
not work.

The best way to assure reproducibility is to use `pytest`. We will
discuss how to do that in class.

We will teach you what to do it is easy.


#### List of Deliverables

In general your deliverables will include the following
(We will address and explain them in a Lab):

* Provide benchmarks.
* Take results in a cloud services and your local PC (ex:
  Chameleon Cloud, echo kubernetes). Make sure your system can be
  created and deployed based on your documentation.
* Each team member must provide a benchmark on their computer and a
  cloud IaaS, where the cloud is different from each team member.
* We require you to write one or more pytest's that deploys, run,
  kill, view, clean that deploys your environment, runs application,
  kills it, views the result and cleans up after wards.
* For python use a requirements.txt file and develop a `setup.py` so
  your code can be installed with `pip install .`
* For docker use a Dockerfile

We will teach you what to do ...

#### Example Outline of a Report

* (If not exempt) write a report that typically includes the following
sections:

  * Abstract
  * Introduction
  * Design
    * Architecture
  * Implementation
    * Technologies Used
  * Results
    * Deployment Benchmarks
    * Application Benchmarks
  * (Limitations)
  * Conclusion
  * (Work Breakdown)

* Your report will **not** have a *Future Work* section as this implies
   that you will do work in future and your paper is incomplete. Hence
   we would not grade it. Instead, you can use an optional "Limitations"
   section.

* Do communicate your status and add a *Workbreakdown* section in which you outline
  which tasks need to be done and by whom in case of a group
  project. Once you have done a task simply include maker a task as
  follows

  ```* [done, Gregor] This was gregors task to showcase how to mark it```

In case you have an exemption for the project report you need to use
`sphinx` and document your code as part of a manual. We will explain the
details in one of our labs.


## Submission

All submissions are conducted via GitHub if not otherwise instructed.
Technology reviews are to be added to the `book` GitHub repo with the
help of pull requests. The TA's will work with you to integrate them.

As we are working continuously throughout the semester you must indicate
your activities in a README.yml file in your GitHub repo. The GitHub
Repo we will define for you in the first 2 weeks of the semester.


An example for the README.yaml file is shown next

```

```

You **MUST** run `yamllint` on the `README.yml` file. YAML errors will cause
point deductions. Any invalid yaml file will result in point deductions.
Please keep your yaml file valid at any time. Our scripts depend on it.
The yaml file will also be used to create a list for TAs to review your
deliverables. If it's not in the yaml file it will not be reviewed.
Please note that it is not sufficient to just run `yamllint`, but to
compare your yaml file carefully with the `README.yml` examples. Make sure
you do the indentation with 2 spaces, do not use the TAB character and
make sure you use the list and attribute organization with proper dash
placement. Work with the TAs if you have difficulties. If you copy, only
copy from the raw content in GitHub. If you work on more

We will teach you what to do it is easy.


## Bonus Projects

This class will not have any bonus projects, as all additional
activities should be put in your project or chapter/review contribution.
However, we will recognize extraordinary efforts in these activities.

## Participation

In addition to these artifacts, there will also be a participation
component in class that will be determined based on your productive
contributions to piazza to help others that have questions and
contributions to the books to, for example, improve sections with
spelling, grammer or content. We can see from the GitHub history if
you conducted such improvements. Make sure that technical
contributions, work on all OSes and are not just targeting a
single OS if the improvement is of general nature (exceptions apply).
