## Lab Activities

Summary: 

* Post your professional bio to piazza
* Setup your computer
* Create the cloud accounts and fill out the form [Cloud Accounts](https://forms.gle/UFr5FcdPcVFwcMvk8)
* Install python on your computer (python 3.7.3 or 3.7.4)
* Update pip
* Install an ePub Reader
  * macOS: Build in use Books
  * Windows 10: Build in use edge
  * others: [Calibre](https://forms.gle/w6ryzEm56rQmwWT38)

Next we provide some more details. If you have questions ask on 
[Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jzkfveoqwri3e4)

### Account Creation

As part of the class you will need a number of accounts. This
includes:

* piazza.com (used for communication)
* github.com (used for project and other class artifacts)
* chameleoncloud.org (free cloud account)
* futuresystems.org (GPU & container)

  * Please join this [project](https://portal.futuresystems.org/project/fg-569)

After you created the accounts, please fill out the following form so we
can set up the class accounts and in cqase of github we create you a
class repository for you.

* [Cloud Accounts](https://forms.gle/UFr5FcdPcVFwcMvk8)

Optional accounts (apply once you need them, some are time limited):

* google.com (optional)
* aws.com (optional)
* azure.com (optional)
* Watson from IBM (optional)
* google Iaas (optional)

We will never ask you for your passwords

### Bio

This activity serves two purposes. First, it tells us we can communicate
with you within [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jzkfveoqwri3e4), and second, you can introduce yourself to others
in piazza to potentially build project or study teams.

### Python 3.7.4

Please set up a computer on which you can do Python development. We
recommend that you use python from <http://python.org>. We will not
provide any support for conda, as conda has hundrest of libraries that
we are not interested in using. Also note that conda modifies your
environment without telling you. Certainly you can use virtualbox, or
containers in case you like to isolate your development environment from
your other systems. Please remember that conda has significant
disadvantages of often working with outdated libraries. As developer of
future software you may want to avoid this. If you use python from
python.org we recommend that you use venv.

### Questionnaire

In this activity you will be filling out a form with information about
you so we can asses show to best integrate you in this class. It is not
important that you know any of the technologies we ask you about.
