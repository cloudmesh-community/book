If you have questions, ask on

more details of each of the assignments in this summary.

### Account Creation

As part of the class, you will need a number of accounts. This
includes:

* piazza.com (used for communication)
* github.com (used for the project and other class artifacts)
* chameleoncloud.org (free cloud account) <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/register/>

<!--
* futuresystems.org (GPU & container)

  * Please join this [project](https://portal.futuresystems.org/project/fg-569)

After you created the accounts, please fill out the following form so we
can set up the class accounts and in case of GitHub we create you a
class repository for you.

* [Class Survey](https://forms.gle/4Zpi2vzpZ5kFSoD1A)
-->

Optional accounts (apply once you need them, some are time limited):

* google.com (optional)
* aws.com (optional)
* azure.com (optional)
* Watson from IBM (optional)
* google Iaas (optional)

We will never ask you for your passwords.

### Survey

In this activity, you will be filling out a form with information
about you so we can assess how to integrate you in this class best. It
is not important that you know any of the technologies we ask you
about.

### Bio

This activity serves two purposes. First, it tells us we can communicate
with you within [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jzkfveoqwri3e4), and
second, you can introduce yourself to others in Piazza to potentially
build project or study teams.

### Python 3.10

Please set up a computer on which you can do Python development. We
recommend that you use python from <http://python.org>. We will not
provide any support for anaconda, as anaconda has hundreds of libraries that
we are not interested in using. Also note that conda modifies your
environment without telling you. Certainly, you can use virtualbox, or
containers in case you like to isolate your development environment from
your other systems. Please remember that conda has significant
disadvantages while often working with outdated libraries. As the developer of
future software, you certainly want to avoid this. If you use python from
python.org we require you that you use venv.

The manual may have references to older versions of python. Also it could be
that some services do not work in newer python versions yet. It will be your
responsibility to find that out and makes sure the services you use have an
appropriate python version. We will not accept any project targeting Python 2 or
smaller than Python 3.9.4. You must use pip version 19.3.1 or newer. As it may
be that newer versions of Python come out during the semester, we like that you
install the newest version. At time this note was written this is 3.10.5. If
a newer version comes out, please install this.

It may be that some cloud services may not work with that version. In that case
it is your responsibility to use or install in parallel a version of python that
works.
