We provide in this document all activities we do in each week

## Lab Activities

* Post your professional bio to piazza
* Setup your computer
* Create the cloud accounds and fill out the form
* Install python on your computer (python 3.7.3 or 3.7.4)
* Update pip

### Account Creation

As part of the class you will need a number of [accounts]{.index}. This
includes:

Required accounts:

* piazza.com (used for communication)
* github.com (used for project and other class artifacts)
* chameleoncloud.org (free cloud account)

Optional accounts (apply once you need them, some are time limited):

* google.com (optional)
* aws.com (optional)
* azure.com (optional)
* Watson from IBM (optional)
* google Iaas (optional)

A survey is to be filled out in the first week of class. It includes
your github.com account that we need to create your github directory
in which you will submit your open source project.

### Bio

This activity serves two purposes. First, it tells us we can communicate
with you within piazza, and second, you can introduce yourself to others
in piazza to potentially build project or study teams.

### Python 3.7.4

Please set up a computer on which you can do Python development. We
recommend that you use python from <http://python.org>. We will not
provide any support for conda, as conda has hundrest of libraries that
we are not interested in using. Also note that conda modifies your
environment without telling you. Certainly you can use virtualbox, or
containers in case you like to isolate your development environment from
your other systems. Please remember that conda has significant
disadvantages of often working with outdated libraries. As developer of
future software you may want to avoid this. If you use python from
python.org we recommend that you use venv.


### Questionnaire

In this activity you will be filling out a form with information about
you so we can asses show to best integrate you in this class.

It will also help us assess if you have done the Lab

:o2: We anticipate it will be posted on Tuesday 27, 2019
