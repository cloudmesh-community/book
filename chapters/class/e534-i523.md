## Course Objectives

This class investigates the use of clouds running data analytics
collaboratively for processing Big Data to solve problems in Big Data
Applications and Analytics. Case studies such as Netflix recommender
systems, Genomic data, Sports, Health, and more will be discussed.

The course has the following objectives:

* Provide an introduction to Big Data
* Provide an introduction to Big Data Analytics
* Provide overviews of different Big Data Application areas
* Explore state-of-the-art big data and cloud technologies and
  services while providing a write up about it and exploring it
  practically with a section that you develop
* Enforce the theoretical knowledge with a project that you conduct in
  one of the application areas.

## Learning Outcomes

* Be able to explain the concepts of the big data paradigm
  including its paradigm shift, its characteristics, and the
  advantages. Contrast them with the challenges and disadvantages.
* Be able to identify bigdata applications and analytical methods needed to
  support real world applications.
* Be able to implement a real world application in big data.
* Be able to conduct sophisticated analysis of big data.
* Be able to communicate the results through sections, chapters, manuals, and
  reports.
* Be able to work in a team to develop collaboratively software or
  contribute collaboratively to develop sections using clouds.

</div>

Students need only to do one project. The project is conducted thought
the entire semester.

(a) Dates may change as the semester evolves

(*) The project is a long term assignment (and are ideally worked on
weekly by residential students). It is the major part of the course
grade.

(*) Sections prepare you for documenting a technical aspect related
to cloud computing. It is a preparation for a document that explains
how to execute your project in a reproducible manner to others.

- all times are in EST

Additional Lectures will be added that allow easy management of the
project. These lectures can be taken any time when needed


## Assessment

This course is focusing on the principal *Learning by Doing* which is
assessed by simple graded and non-graded activities. The assessment may
include comprehension of the material taught, programming assignments,
participation in online discussion forums, or the contribution of
additional material to the class showcasing your comprehension.

The comprehension is also measured by the development of one or more sections in
markdown that can be distributed and replicated to other
students. This is done in preparation for the project that must
include a simple deployment and runtime instruction set.

The main deliverable of the class is a project. The project is
assessed through the following artifacts:

* (a) Deployment and install instructions, 
* (b) Project report (typically 2-3 pages per month, sections and
  chapters can be reused if possible), 
* (c) Working project code that can be installed and executed in reproducible manner by a third party 
* (d) Code developed by the project team distributed in github.com
* (e) Project progress notes checked into github throughout the semester. Each 
  week the project progress is reported and will be integrated
  into the final grade.
* (f) three discussions or progress reports with the instructors about your project

The grade distribution is as follows 

* 10% Comprehension Activities
* 10% Section
* 10% Chapter
* 70% Project

As the project is the main deliverable of the course it is obvious
that those starting a week before the deadline will not succeed in this
class. The project will take a significant amount of time and fosters
the principal of "Learning by Doing" at all stages throughout the
semester.

The class will not have a regular midterm, but it is expected that you
have worked on your project and can provide a snapshot of the progress
outlining the goals of the project and how you will achieve these
goals till the end of the semester.

The final Project is due Dec. 1st. Issues with your project ought to
have been discussed before this deadline with the TA's The TAs will in
the next 14 days go over the projects and evaluate major and minor
issues that you may be able to fix without penalty. Larger changes
will receive a grade penalty. The last fix (upon approval) possible
will be Dec 7th.

### Incomplete

Please see the university regulations for getting an
incomplete. However, as this class uses state-of-the-art technology
that changes frequently, you must expect that an incomplete may result
in significant additional work on your behalf as your project may need
significant updates on infrastructure, technology, or even programming
models used. It is best to complete the course within one semester.
