## Plagiarism

In the first week(s) of class you will need to read the information about
plagiarism. If there are any questions about plagiarism we require you
to take a course offered from the IU educational department.

Warning:

> If we find cheating or plagiarism, your assignment will be receiving
> an F. This especially includes copying text without proper
> attribution. We are required to follow IU policy and report your
> case to the dean of students who may elect to expel you form the
> university. Please understand that it is your doing and the
> instructors have no choice as to follow university policies. Thus,
> please do not blame the instructors for your actions. Excuses such
> as "I missed the lecture on plagiarism", "I forgot to include the
> original reference as I ran out of time", "I did not understand
> what plagiarism is" do not apply as we explicitly make
> the policies clear. This applies to all material prepared for class
> including assignments, exercises, code, sections, tutorials, papers, and
> projects. If there is no time, do not submit and instead of an F ask
> for an incomplete. In fact if you know you have plagiarized, do not
> even have us review your paper.
