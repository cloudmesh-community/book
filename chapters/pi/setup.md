# Cluster Setup :o2:

![No](images/no.png)

In this section we discuss how we setup the cluster. To explore that we
can conduct the setup without monitor, we are collecting in this section
a variety of tasks in regards to it and documenting solutions for them.
Students in the residential or in the online classes that participate in
cluster building can contribute to this section.

A number of students have been assigned for particular tasks. and will
be added here by the TA's. It is expected that you conduct your task
ASAP.

## Links

A number of useful links may help for this task. However be aware that
we want to develop a *script* for most of the tasks eliminating input by
hand. The information here deals to identifying the information needed
to do so.

According to

<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md>

rasp-config writes a file /boot/config.txt. Maybe it is a good idea to
inspect this file manipulate it and see if there are field we simply
could write and overwrite it on the SD card. See also
