## Exercise

### Single Raspberry Pi Temperature

You have been presented in Section
[Cluster Case With Cooling (5 Pi)](#cluster-case-with-cooling-5-pi)
with a table that
compares tempreatures. Your task is to identify issues with the
experiment and the table. Furthermore we like you to rerun a
temperature experiment in the entire class.

1. Get a PI3 modeL B, an HDMI cable, a power supply, a case. Such a
 configuration is listed in the IoT section.

2. Buy or manufacture a case of your choice. You can use a 3d-printer
 if you have one available.

3. Conduct a temperature experiment.

Discussion of these assignment is to be executed openly in class. Points
will be issued only once the class agrees upon an experiment.

This exercise is not only to learn about the behaviour of the Pi, but
also about how to coordinate experiments with a large number of
students.

Pi.Single.1

: What temperature measurement is missing from the table.

Pi.Single.2

: How would you create an experiment under *load*.

Pi.Single.3

: How would you create an experiment to which all students in
  different classes could contribute their values? Can the cloud be
  used?

Pi.Single.4

: Collect the information from all class members using cloud services.

Pi.Single.5

: Identify how to use the VPN server so you can use your Laptop
instead of a TV or computer monitor. Write a tutorial.

### Small Pi Cluster

In this set of exercises we will be building a small Raspberry Pi
cluster. All of you will have to do exercise Pi.Cluster.Build as well
as one of the tasks related to Swarm, kubernetes or Spark.

It is important that you write down all steps very carefully as you are
expected to use the steps to develop an automated deployment. For your
cluster. Your tutorial will be tested by other groups and easy of
installation completness, and correctness will be evaluated. Teams that
find issues and improve deployment tutorials will receive points. TA's
will also replicate these steps to identify a fair evaluation without
bias.

Pi.Cluster.Build

: Build groups of up to 5 people. Make a plan on what needs to be done
  to build the cluster and develop a schedule.  Include in this plan (a)
  obtaining the material the hardware build, (b) the installation of the
  operating system (c) the testing of the system (d) familiarizing with
  the OS.

Pi.Cluster.DockerSwarm

: Install a docker Swarm cluster on your PI. Develop a tutorial in
  markdown and mind plagiarism. Contribute your tutorial to this
  document to get acknowledged and credit. Work with others in class to
  coordinate a single tutorial.

Pi.Cluster.Kubernetes

: Install a kubernetes cluster on your PI. Develop a tutorial in
  markdown and mind plagiarism. Contribute your tutorial to this
  document to get acknowledged and credit. Work with others in class to
  coordinate a single tutorial.

Pi.Cluster.Spark

: Install a spark cluster on your PI. Develop a tutorial in markdown
  and mind plagiarism. Contribute your tutorial to this document to get
  acknowledged and credit. Work with others in class to coordinate a
  single tutorial.

### Cluster Case

IN this exercise you will be designing a cluster case so you can put
the PI's in a professional looking case that also protects the
equipment.

It will be up to you to decide upon the form factor of the case.
Please consult with the appropriate sections as you will need to fit
in not only the PIs but also the parts.

Please use OpenSCAD as basis. You may also try FreeCAD.

PI.case.ClusterHat

: Design a case for the Cluster Hat


PI.case.5

: Design a case

PI.case.n

Please reuse the Pi.Case.5 as basis, e.g. it is a shelf in which we
place the cases. Make sure to organize power and allow for easy access
to the cases and the pis within the case.

### Cluster Case Lego

Pi.lego 1

: count the connectors and make a more accurate calculation

Pi.lego 2

: design a frame in which the PIs can be placed in groups of 5.

Pi.lego.3

: design a cluster case for the raspberry PI with LDD
  <https://www.lego.com/en-us/ldd>. YOu do not have to buy the pieces,
  but just provide the design.
