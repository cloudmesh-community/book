To prevent Raspberry Pis from being hacked the RPi foundation have now
disabled SSH on the default image. So, create a text file in /boot/
called ssh - it can be empty file or you can type anything you want
inside it.

Please note that you have renamed the ssh.txt to ssh i.e. without
extension.

Now insert the SD card, networking and power etc.

change the hostname Raspberry Pi in:
