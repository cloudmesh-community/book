# Raspberry PI Hadoop Cluster :o2:

:o2:

## Todo

- [ ] all the simple setup with sd cards, ssh, keys, and so on should be moved to the NOW cluster section. This way we can require simply a NOW and start without duplication on the real kubernetes install.
- [ ] so before you can work on the section you need to make sure the NOW section is up to date.
