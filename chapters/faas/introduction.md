## FaaS :o:

### Introduction
FaaS or Function as a service is a new paradim in cloud computing that is gaining popularity recently. FaaS is also
known as Serverless Computing to some. While the name Serverless implies that no servers are involved this is not true. 
So FaaS would be a better term to describe this technology. FaaS is built around functions and events. Functions are
generally stateless and are executed within isolated containers. The execution of the functions can be thought of as an 
event driven model. A program or application in FaaS consist of a set of functions and a set of events or triggers that 
invoke or activate those functions. A function activation can result in another function activation as a result.
