Google Cloud Function is Google's offering for Function as a
Service. It enables serverless computing and offers functions as
services on Google Cloud Platform drivenby trigger events from Cloud
Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, HTTP or changes in log in Stackdriver
logging. Cloud functions can also be invoked for real time mobile
changes.  Google Cloud page on cloud functions

* <https://cloud.google.com/functions/use-cases/>

gives more detail about the use cases such as Serverless application
backends, Real-time data processing, Intelligent applications - all
without the need of provisioning a server instance or the overhead of
managing a server instance. The functions are invoked as services
whenever needed for a business requirement and the cost is billed as
per the minutes of usage just for the function execution time. The
Google Cloud Functions can be written in Node.js or Python. For Python
runtime environment refer to the page

* <https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/python-runtime>

For Node.js 6 runtime environment refer to the page

* <https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/nodejs-6-runtime>

For Node.js 8 runtime environment refer to the page

* https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/nodejs-8-runtime>

## Google Cloud Function Example

Following from the example as presented in AWS Lambda section, we will
look into a simple example of building a Google Cloud Function to
check if a string is Palindrome or not.  The implementation will be in
Python and we will use Python runtime environment. We will use HTTP
trigger to invoke the function using HTTP request. We will also use
the Google Cloud Console to build, deploy and test the
function. Finally we will use HTTP url to send request to the function
to get the result of our query.

Let us begin:

**Step 1**: Login to Google Cloud Platform with your GCP account. We
are using free tier for this demonstration. Refer to the section for
Google Cloud in the epub for creting a free tier GCP account.

**Step 2**: Select or create a Project and go to dashboard (see
@fig:google-dashboard)

![Login to Project and Dashboard](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031131045280.png){#fig:google-dashboard}


**Step 3**: Click "Create a Cloud Function" (see @fig:GCPCreateFunction)

![Create a Function](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031131915230.png){#fig:GCPCreateFunction}


**Step 4**: Enable cloud function API if it is not enabled:(see @fig:GCPApi)

![Enable the API](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031131927588.png){#fig:GCPApi}


**Step 5**: Click Create Function (see @fig:CreateFunction)

![Select Create Function](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031131938895.png){#fig:CreateFunction}


**Step 6**: In the next page, give a name to the function. In our case
we are giving function name as isPalindrome. Specify the memory (128
mb is good for this demo). Select the function trigger as
HTTP. Choose inline editor for the source code and finally
Python 3.7 as the run time environment.(see @fig:NameFunction)

**Step 7**: In the inline source editor, write a Python function and
then click Create. We have written a Python function to check for
Palindrome string. NOTE: This is not an optimized Python code, it is
just used here for demonstration purpose. This function can be
optimized further with Python standards style writing.(see @fig:PythonCode)

**Step 8**: The function is created and deployed in the next page (see
@fig:google-FunctionDeployed-1) and @fig:google-FunctionDeployed-2)

![Function is Deployed](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031132532494.png){#fig:google-FunctionDeployed-1}

![Function is Deployed](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031132602827.png){#fig:google-FunctionDeployed-2}


**Step 9**: Finally we will test the function (see @fig:TestFunction)

![Test The Function](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031132627791.png){#fig:TestFunction}


**Step 10**: In the Trigger event box, write a HTTP message request in
JSON format and click Test the Function (see @fig:TriggerEvent)

![Trigger Event](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031132734293.png){#fig:TriggerEvent}


**Step 11**: The response box will show the result of the test as expected (see @fig:Result)

![Result](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031132838134.png){#fig:Result}


**Step 12**: Let us run one more Test (see @fig:TestAgain)

![Another Test](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031132912372.png){#fig:TestAgain}


**Step 13**: You will get the expected result (see @fig:ExpectedResultForTest)

![Expected Result For Test](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031132940621.png){#fig:ExpectedResultForTest}


**Step 14**: Let us test our function deployment using url. Click on the function name (see @fig:DeploymentUrl)

![Deployment Url](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031133107580.png){#fig:DeploymentUrl}


**Step 15**: In the next page, click on Trigger page and copy the url (see @fig:TriggerUrl)

![Trigger Url](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031133237491.png){#fig:TriggerUrl}


**Step 16**: In a web browser type the url and add the HTTP request to
it and hit enter

* <https://us-central1-test-functions-12345.cloudfunctions.net/isPalindrome?message=abcd>


**Step 17**: You will get a response back from the function(see @fig:TestHttp)

![Test Http](images/markdown-img-paste-20181031133547391.png){#fig:TestHttp}


**Step 18**: Another test (see @fig:AnotherHttpTest)
