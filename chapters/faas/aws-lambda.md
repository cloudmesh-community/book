# AWS Lambda

## Introduction

AWS Lambda is considered as one of the earliest FaaS implementations made 
available to end users. AWS Lambda provides a rich set of features that can 
be leveraged by users to build programs and applications on top of the FaaS 
framework. AWS Lambda supports many event types that developers can use to 
orchestrate their FaaS applications. And in line with the FaaS model AWS 
Lambda only charges users for actual execution time of the functions. For 
example if you host and deploy a function on AWS Lambda and only execute it for
1 minute every day you will only be charged for the 1 minute execution time. 

AWS does not share how the internals of AWS Lambda work in detail but as with
any general FaaS framework it should be leveraging various container 
technologies underneath. You can get a better understanding on how the 
internals of a FaaS framework is organized by looking at the [OpenWhisk 
Section](openwhisk.md)

## AWS Lambda Features

AWS Lambda provides many features that allows the creation of an FaaS 
application straight forward. An FaaS application normally consist of a set of
functions and a set of events that activate or invoke those functions. AWS 
Lambda supports several programing languages that allow developers to develop
the function they require in any of the programming languages that are 
supported. The following list show the programming languages that are currently
supported by AWS Lambda for function creation.

* Node.js (JavaScript)
* Python
* Java (Java 8 compatible)
* C# (.NET Core)
* Go

Other than the functions the most important requirement for a good FaaS
framework is a rich set of function invocation methods which allow users to 
tie together different events that happen in the echo system with the FaaS 
application. In this regard AWS Lambda supports many event sources, mainly from
the AWS echo system. AWS documentation provides a complete list of supported
event sources at [AWS Lambda event sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invoking-lambda-function.html).
For example a developer can configure an function to be invoked when a S3 bucket
is updated, or configure an function to be invoked based on inputs received by 
Amazon Alexa, etc.

## Understanding Function limitations

Before you start working on FaaS frameworks it is important to understand the
limitations and restrictions that are applied to functions. The limits and 
restrictions discussed in the section are applicable to most FaaS frameworks 
but the exact values may differ based on the FaaS vendor. However the reason for
most of the limitations are to maintain performance requirements. We will 
discuss several major limits below. For a complete list of limits in AWS Lambda 
please refer to the limits documentation [AWS Lambda Function Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html) 

### Execution Time

AWS Lambda limits the execution length of a function. Currently it is set to 
15 minutes but was set at 300s previously, so the function limits have and 
may change with time. Other FaaS provides have different values for execution
time limits, but in general each FaaS provider does define a execution time 
limit

### Function size

AWS Lambda also sets several memory and storage limits for functions. Currently
the maximum memory allocated to a function is 3008MB and the maximum allocated 
storage space is 512MB. However it is good to keep in mind that monetary charge
for function execution increases with the amount of memory that is specified 
for the function. 

## Understanding the free Tier 

If new users want to experiment with AWS lambda, AWS does provide a free tier
for AWS Lambda, which include 1 million function invocations per month. You can 
find a more detailed description of the free tier in the AWS docs [AWS Lambda
 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/).
 
 
## Writing your fist Lambda function

With the GUI interface it is relatively easy to try out your first Serverless
function with AWS Lambda. Please follow the steps defined at 
[How to run your first AWS Lambda function in the cloud](../iaas/aws/aws-lambda.md#how-to-run-your-first-aws-lambda-function-in-the-cloud---example)
