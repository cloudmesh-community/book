# Development Compute Server

While interacting with clusters we need a computer from which we can
log into the cluster. Such a computer could be your Laptop hosting macOS
or Windows10 as an operating system.

## macOS

macOS is a very good OS to conduct our work. We have done A lot of
activities on macOS and know it works. To make thinks more UNIX like we
recommend that you use `homebrew`.

## Windows 10 Education or Pro

Please note that Windows 10 home edition does not support many of the
advanced system and thus, if you like to use Windows 10, we recommend
that you either purchase a full version of Windows 10 and upgrade to
it, or you obtain the educational version. Please make sure that you
do a backup of all your data before you start. The educational version
of Windows is freely available to students from many educational
institutions. When you upgrade, use the 64 bit version. Make sure your
computer supports this.

Furthermore, Microsoft has recently made significant progress in
supporting Linux on their OS. We recommend that you install it and
use. Alternatively we recommend that you use git for windows which you
can get from this [link](https://gitforwindows.org/).

## Older Version of Windows or Windows 10 Home

Older versions of Windows or Windows 10 Home **are not supported**.
Please trust us and **do not use such an OS**. We recommend you
upgrade or to just use an OS that you can boot from a USB stick. There
are for example many tutorials available that explain how to create a
USB stick that boots Ubuntu. When you upgrade, use the 64 bit
version. Make sure your computer supports this.

## Raspberry PI

A very good option is to use a Raspberry PI as login server. Naturally
you may not be able to run LaTeX on it, but it will be sufficient for
learning python, shell scripting and interacting with the cluster.
Due to it's cheap price (typically <$40 for the board, <$5 for a HDMI
cable, and $5 for a power plug (never use your Laptop as power source
as it may damage your laptop), you can get started for about $50. As
you may want to protect you PI, you can also get a cheap case for
about $8. When it comes to the power supply, make sure to buy one that
has a power switch included. This helps when rebooting. To enable this
solution please see Section [A Single Pi](#a-single-pi).
