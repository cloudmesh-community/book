# Assignments

We have three graded assignments all other activities are geard
towards supporting these assignments. The first two assignments are
created in such a way that they could (but do not have to or may not)
support your class project.  The assignments are posted in piazza in
the `assignments` folder. The three assignments are:

* Section contributions
* Chapter contributions
* Project

To conduct these assignments you will need a number of accounts.


## Account Creation

As setting up your computer is not really an assignment but a
precondition, we do not grade you on this. Furthermore, we want you to
post a formal Bio to piazza after you have gained access. This serves
two purposes. First, it tells us we can communicate with you within
piazza, and second, you can introduce yourself to others in piazza to
potentially build project or study teams.

As part of the class you will need a number of [accounts]{.index}

* piazza.com (used for communication)
* github.com (used for project and other class artifacts)
* futuresystems.org (free docker account)
* chameleoncloud.org (free cloud account)
* google.com (optional)
* aws.com (optional)
* azure.com (optional)
* Watson from IBM (optional)
* google Iaas (optional)

A survey is to be filled out in the first week of class. It includes
your github.com account that we need to create your github directory
in which you will submit your open source project.

## Sections, Chapters with Examples

As part of the class, we expect you to get familiar with topics
related to cloud computing beyond what we have written in the lecture
notes. This is done in Sections, Chapters with Examples. These
assignments are done so you do not have to do other weekly homework or
tests and exams. They showcase your understanding of the field.

**Section:**

: A section is a small section that explains a topic that is not yet
  in the handbook or improves an existing section significantly. It is
  typically multi-paragraphs long and can even include an example if
  needed. Sections can be theoretical, or programming related
  sections.  Typically an A+ student contributes more than 5 such
  sections or replaces multiple sections with an additional or longer
  chapter.

:  Sample sections contributed by students include:

   * Section [Microsoft Nafik Data Center](#sec:natick)
   * Section [Lambda Expressions](#lambda-expressions)

**Chapter with Example:**

: A chapter is a much longer topic and is a coherent description of a
  topic related to cloud computing. A chapter could either be a review
  of a topic or a detailed technical contribution. Several Sections
  (10+) may be a substitute for a chapter.  You will be contributing a
  unique **significant** chapter that can be used by other students in
  the class and introduces the reader to a general topic related to
  the topic of the class.  You will create a *unique non existing*
  chapter that can be shared with other students of this
  class. Chapters can be theoretical, but most often students prefer
  the creation of practical contributions.  When doing a practical
  section, it is expected to develop a practical example demonstrating
  how to use a technology. The chapter and the practical example can
  be done together. We do not like to use the term tutorial in our
  writeup *at all* . Chapters that focus on theory may not have an
  example and as such it can be substituted by a longer text. In case
  no example is provided the example can be substituted in some cases
  by a review or comparison.

  In case the chapter includes an example (or multiple) it is recorded
  in a reproducible fashion. We will not accept screenshots for simple
  command line examples as documented in our
  [Section Notation](#sec:notation) To remind you examples augment
  Chapters as well as Sections. A sample of a student contributed
  chapter is

   * [GraphQL](#s-graphql).


> ![Warning](images/warning.png) *It is expected from you that you self identify a section
> or a chapter as this shows competence in the area of cloud
> computing. If however you do not know what to select, you must attend
> an online hour with us in which we identify sections and chapters with

Sample Topics that could form a section or chapter are clearly marked
with a ![Question](images/question.png) or a ![No](images/no.png). and are integrated in the github
issues, see [Section Gitissues](#sec:gitissues-list). There will be
plenty in the handbook, but you are welcome to define your own
contributions. Discuss them with us in the online hours. To guarantee
that they are unique and others know about it you will file a github
issue for it once it is approved by us via a discussion either in an
online hour or piazza.

In addition you can use the following volume to identify technologies
that may interrest you.

## Mini Projects that could Substitute a Chapter

In some special cases it is possible to substitute the chapter and/or
section contributions with an additional mini project, that however
still has to be documented. An example of such a mini project is our
`cm-burn` command that creates Raspberry PI OS based on
manipulation of the file system

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm-burn>

Please note that this is not less work than developing a chapter
and/or sections. You still will have to do a class project as the mini
project does not substitute the class project.

A mini project may be related to topics such as:

* Raspberry PI
* Sechi Disk Partial Image Analysis
* NIST OpenAPI definition and implementation

Mini projects must be suggested and approved by Dr. Gregor von Laszewski.

If you choose the *Cloudmesh Version 4* project, you are allowed to
substitute Sections and Mini Chapters with a single large project that
requires less documentation. However, you must contribute to this
project in a significant way. The project link is

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm>

and contains an alpha version which is currently worked on. Please do
not expect that the documentation is up to date. Residential students
most frequently chose this as option. All programming in the project
is done in python and weekly updates are discussed in meetings or in
github.

## Project

Project

: A project is the major activity that you chose as part of your
  class. The default case is an implementation project that requires a
  *project report* and project code.  You will create a significant
  non-trivial project related to cloud computing and cloud
  engineering. Up to three people can collaborate. The project could
  be built on top of a previous project but must have significant
  additions or modifications. If a previous project is used, a detailed
  discussion is to be held on what has been improved. We will discuss
  projects in one of our future lectures. There are a lot of examples
  in our other class publications.

License:

: All projects are developed under an open source license, such as the
  Apache 2.0 License. You will be required to add a LICENCE.txt file
  and describe how other software, if used, can be reused in your
  project. If your project uses different licenses, please add a
  README.md file that describes which packages are used and what
  licenses these packages have.

Project Report:

: A project report is to be delivered and continuously improved
  throughout the semester in github accessible to the instructors. It
  includes not just the analysis of a topic, but a short description
  of the Architecture and code, with **benchmarks** and demonstrated
  use. Obviously it is longer than a term paper and
  includes descriptions about reproducibility of the application. A
  README.md is provided that describes how others can reproduce your
  project and run it. Remember that tables and figures do not count towards
  the paper length. The following length is required:

  -   6 pages (ACM format), one student in the project
  -   8 pages (ACM format), two students in the project
  -   10 pages (ACM format), three students in the project

  Please note that we no longer use the ACM format but, instead, use
  markdown. All project reports are to be delivered in markdown. A
  sample format is located in github at

  * <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/proceedings-fa18/tree/master/project-report>

  A single page has about 1000 words in ACM format. References are managed in
  bibtex as documented in:

  * <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/vonLaszewski-writing-markdown.epub?raw=true>

Project Code:

: This is the **documented** and **reproducible** code and scripts
  that allows a TA to replicate the project. In case you use images,
  they must be created from **scratch locally** and may not be
  uploaded to services such as dockerhub. You can, however, reuse
  approved vendor uploaded images such as from ubuntu or centos. All
  code, scripts, and documentation must be uploaded to github.com
  under the class specific github directory.

Data:

: Data is to be hosted on IU's Google drive, if needed. If you have
  larger data, it should be downloaded from the internet. It is
  your responsibility to develop a download program. The data **must**
  not be stored in GitHub. You are expected to write a python
  program that downloads the data either from the Web or IU's data
  storage.

Work Breakdown:

: This is an appendix to the document that describes in bullet form
   who did what in the project. This section comes on a new page
   after the references. It does not count towards the page length of
   the document. It also includes explicit URLs to the git history
   that documents the statistics to demonstrate more than one student
   has worked on the project. If you can not provide such a statistic
   or all check-ins have been made by a single student, the project
   has shown that they have not properly used git. Thus, points will
   be deducted from the project. Furthermore, if we detect that a
   student has not contributed to a project, we may invite the student
   to give a detailed oral presentation of the project.

Bibliography:

: All bibliography has to be provided in a bibtex file that **MUST**
  either be validated with **jabref** or with **emacs**. There is **NO
  EXCEPTION** to this rule. Please be advised doing references right
  takes some time so you want to do this early and throughout the
  semester. What would take less than 5 minutes a week, could quickly
  add up to multiple hours at the end of the semester. Please note
  that exports of Endnote or other bibliography management tools do
  not lead to properly formatted bibtex files, despite their claims
  of doing so. You will have to clean them up and we recommend to do it
  the other way around. Hence, the easiest way to manage your
  bibliography is with jabref or emacs. Make sure **labels** only include
  characters from [a-zA-Z0-9-]. Use dashes and not underscore and
  colons (`_` ,`:`) in the label. We will deduct points if you submit
  an invalid bibtex file to github. So please make sure your file is
  validated. You can even create your own checks with tools such as
  biber.

### Project Deliverables

The objective of the project is to define a clear problem statement
and create a framework to address that problem as it relates to cloud
computing. In this class it is especially important to address the
reproducibility of the deployment. A test and benchmark, possibly
including a dataset, must be used to verify the correctness of your
approach. Projects related to NIST and Cloudmesh Version 4 focus on
the specification and implementation. The report here can be smaller
but the contribution must be includable in the specification document.

In general, any project must be deployable by the TA. If it takes hours
to deploy your project, please talk to us before final
submission. This should not be the case. Also, if it takes 100 steps,
we are sure you can automate them ... as you are likely doing something
wrong or have not thought about cloud computing where we tend to
automate most of the steps.

You have plenty of time to execute a wonderful project but you need to
work consistently on it. Starting one week before the deadline will
not work.

The deliverables included need to be updated according to your
specific project throughout the semester, for example if you do Edge
Computing some deliverables will be different. In general your
deliverables will include the following:

- Provide benchmarks.

- Take results in a cloud services and your local PC (ex:
  Chameleon Cloud, echo kubernetes). Make sure your system can be
  created and deployed based on your documentation.

- Each team member must provide a benchmark on their computer and a
  cloud IaaS, where the cloud is different from each team member.

- We strongly suggest to create a Makefile with the tags deploy, run,
  kill, view, clean that deploys your environment, runs application,
  kills it, views the result and cleans up after wards. You are
  allowed to have different makefiles for the different clouds and
  different directories. Keep the code and directory structure clean
  and document how to reproduce your results.

- For python use a requirements.txt file and develop a `setup.py` so
  your code can be installed with `pip install .`

- For docker use a Dockerfile

- Write a report that typically includes the following sections:

  * Abstract
  * Introduction
  * Design
    * Architecture
  * Implementation
    * Technologies Used
  * Results
    * Deployment Benchmarks
    * Application Benchmarks
  * (Limitations)
  * Conclusion
  * (Work Breakdown)

* Your paper will **not** have a *Future Work* section as this implies
   that you will do work in future and your paper is incomplete. Hence
   we would not grade it. Instead, you can use an optional "Limitations"
   section.

* Do communicate your status add a *Workbreakdown* section in which you outline
  which tasks need to be done and by whom in case of a group
  project. Once you have done a task simply include maker a task as
  follows

  ```* [done, Gregor] This was gregors task to showcase how to mark it```

## Project: Virtual Cluster

As previously stated, all students can contribute and participate on
the creation of the Cloud service mesh project called Cloudmesh
Version 4 that we will be using throughout the class to improve and
interface with cloud and container frameworks.  This project is
managed at:

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm>

Residential students will work on this project and meet in a
discussion group to work on it while having weekly assigned tasks they
define with us. Online students are welcome to join this project and
their tasks will be discussed in online hours. You will also need
weekly time to work on it.  Online students that are in the
Bloomington area, are welcome to join our residential meetings (Please
contact Gregor via piazza).

Work on cloudmesh cm4, cm-burn or the NIST REST Specification document
can reduce the project report deliverable (in size) while substituting
it with a **significant** larger programming contribution.

* In case of cm4 we may write collaboratively a report but focus on
  the manual first
* In case of cm-burn we will work on a report that we publish in the
  Raspberry community
* In case of NIST you will be expected to contribute to the NIST
  Specification.

In addition to interfacing with clouds via an API, we are also
interested in displaying the interactions in Javascript. So if you have
Javascript skills this may be a good opportunity for you to contribute
to the project with your previous knowledge.

## Submission of sections and chapters and projects

Sections and subsections are to be added to the `book` github repo. Do
a pull request. Initially they will be managed in your own github repo
that we will set up for you. They will be added to the book after they
have been reviewed and approved.

The headline of the section needs to be marked with a
![Construction](images/construction.png) if you are working on it and marked with a ![Smiley](images/smile.png) if you want it
to be graded and have included all hids for people that contributed to that
section.

In addition, simply add them to your README.yml file in your github repo.
Add the following to it (I am using a18-516-18 as example).

Please look at <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/fa18-516-18> and <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudmesh-community/fa18-523-62/master/README.yml>
for an examples. Please note that if you work in a group, the code and report is supposed to be only stored
in the first hid mentioned in the group field. If you store it in multiple directories your project will be rejected.

        - title: title of the section 1
          url: https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/chapters/...

You **MUST** run yamllint on the README.yml file. YAML errors will
cause point deductions. Any invalid yaml file will result in point
deductions. Please keep your yaml file valid at any time. Our scripts
depend on it. The yaml file will also be used to create a list for TAs
to review your deliverables. If it's not in the yaml file it will not
be reviewed. Please note that it is not sufficient to just run
yamllint, but to compare your yaml file carefully with the README.yml
examples. Make sure you do the indentation with 2 spaces, do not use
the TAB character and make sure you use the list and attribute
organization with proper dash placement.

More details will be posted throughout the semester. Work with the TAs
if you have difficulties, but it's good to copy and paste from a
working example. Depending on class, your format may be slightly
different. We will inform you if additional format changes are needed
throughout the semester.

## Participation

In addition to these artifacts, there will also be a participation
component in class that will be determined based on your productive
contributions to piazza to help others that have questions and
contributions to the books to, for example, improve sections with
spelling, grammer or content. We can see from the github history if
you conducted such improvements. Make sure that technical
contributions, work on all OSes and are not just targeting a
single OS if the improvement is of general nature (exceptions apply).
