HBase WordCount
===============



\TODO{Hyungro: fix hyperlinks, use exercise instead or project where
  appropriate}
Write an HBase WordCount program to count all unique terms' occurrences
from the clueWeb09 dataset. Each row record of columnfamily
\"frequencies\" is unique; the rowkey is the unique term stored in byte
format, column name is \"count\" and value is the term frequency shown
in all documents. Load the result to HBase WordCountTable.
Figure [\[fig:wordcounttablescheme\]](#fig:wordcounttablescheme){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:wordcounttablescheme"} shows the schema of
WordCountTable. You will compare the results of your finished run to a
correct version we will supply to you.

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to load data to HBase before trying this assignment.
Please follow **instructions in HBase** for more information.

Introduction
------------

WordCount is a simple program which counts the number of occurrences of
each word in a given text input dataset. It fits very well with the
map/reduce programming model, making WordCount a great example to
understand the Hadoop MapReduce programming style. Instead of loading
the data from HDFS, we will load our data directly from existing HBase
records which store the similar content structures on HBase and HDFS.

In this homework and the next homework (Building an Inverted Index) we
use the same source code, which can be found in:
*/root/MoocHomeworks/HBaseWordCount*.

### Clueweb09 dataset

We are using the ClueWeb09 dataset, which was created to support
research on information retrieval and related human language
technologies. It consists of about 1 billion webpages in ten languages
that were collected in January and February 2009. The dataset is used by
several tracks of the TREC conference (See [Useful
Links](#link_exercise4)). Since the ClueWeb09 dataset is composed of
webpages crawled from the Internet, the uploaded table schemas are
designed as shown in Figure 2.

dataset[]{label="fig:datatablescheme"}](section/icloud/assignment/exercise4/datatablescheme)

So, while similar to Hadoop WordCount (See [Useful
Links](#link_exercise4)), the differences are that data is stored on
HBase and URI is the \"filename\" that contains all the text content.

### Mapper, Reducer and Main Program

Now we are going to implement the HBase WordCount. Our implementation
consists of three main parts:

-   Mapper

-   Reducer

-   Main program

### Mapper

A Mapper overrides the map function from the Class
\"org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TableMapper$<$Text,
LongWritable$>$\" which provides $<$key, value$>$ pairs as the input. A
Mapper implementation may output $<$key, value$>$ pairs using the
provided Context. $<$key, value$>$ of this map function is $<$rowkey,
content$>$, where the key is the rowkey of an HBase record related to a
specified URI, and the content is the stored text of that URI. Your Map
task should output $<$word, frequency$>$ for each word in the content of
text.

*Pseudocode*

``` {language="java"}
void Map (key, value){
    for each word x in the content of a hbase record:
    context.write(x, freq);
}
```

*Detailed implementation*

``` {language="java"}
static class WcMapper extends TableMapper<Text, LongWritable> {
        @Override
        public void map(ImmutableBytesWritable row, Result result, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
            byte[] contentBytes = result.getValue(Constants.CF_DETAILS_BYTES, Constants.QUAL_CONTENT_BYTES);
            String content = Bytes.toString(contentBytes);

            // TODO: write your implementation for counting words in each row, and generating a <word, count> pair
            // Hint: use the "getWordFreq" function to count the frequencies of words in content

        }
}
```

### Reducer

A Reducer collects the intermediate $<$key, value$>$ output from
multiple map tasks and assembles a single result. Here, the reducer
function will sum up the occurrence of each word to pairs as $<$word,
occurrence$>$, then write it back to an HBase table with put operations
which contain the key-value pair information of each word.

*Pseudocode*

``` {language="java"}
void Reduce (keyword, <list of value>){
    for each x in <list of value>:
        sum+=x;
        context.write(rowkey(x), freq);
}
```

*Detailed implementation*

``` {language="java"}
public static class WcReducer extends TableReducer<Text, LongWritable, ImmutableBytesWritable> {
        @Override
    public void reduce(Text word, Iterable<LongWritable> freqs, Context context)
                throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        /*TODO: write your implementation for getting the final count of each word
        and putting it into the word count table
        Hint -- the schema of the WordCountTable is:
           rowkey: a word, column family: "frequencies",
           column name: "count", cell value: count of the word
        Check iu.pti.hbaseapp.Constants for the constant values to use.
    */
        long totalFreq = 0;
     }
}

```

### Main program

The main function has been provided as standard initialization, although
you can modify it to suit your own style. Hint: the provided code is
designed for using put operations in the reducer content.write()
function. Before writing the codes, please read the HBase MapReduce
tutorial first (See [Useful Links](#link_exercise4)).

Edit
----

The sketch code is stored within the provided VirtualBox image
Environment Setup. You may use linux text editor vi/vim to add your
code.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ cd /root/MoocHomeworks/HBaseWordCount/
$ vim src/iu/pti/hbaseapp/clueweb09/WordCountClueWeb09.java
uend{lstlisting}

\subsection{Compile and run your code}
For your convenience, we have provided a one-click script
compileAndExecWordCount.sh for compiling and execution. Standard error messages
such as "compile errors, execution errors, etc." will be redirected on the
screen. You may debug it based on the returned messages.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ cd /root/MoocHomeworks/HBaseWordCount
$ ./compileAndExecWordCount.sh
```
