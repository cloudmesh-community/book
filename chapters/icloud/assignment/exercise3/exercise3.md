Hadoop Blast
============



By this point you should have gone over the sections concerning Hadoop
Setup and a few Hadoop programs. Now you are going to blend these
applications by implementing a parallel version of BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool:

* <http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi>

using the programming interfaces of the Hadoop MapReduce framework. Note
that this application is written in \"Map-Only\" fashion, which means no
reduce code is necessary.

Deliverables
------------

You are required to turn in the following items in a zip file
(username_HadoopBlast.zip)

-   The source code of Hadoop Blast you implemented.

-   Technical report (username_HadoopBlast_report.docx) that answers
    the following questions.

    -   What is Hadoop Distributed Cache and how is it used in this
        program?

    -   Write the two lines that put and get values from Distributed
        cache. Also include the method and class information.

    -   In previous exercises we used Hadoop's TextInputFormat to feed
        in the file splits line by line to map tasks. In this program,
        however, we want to feed in a whole file to a single map task.
        What is the technique used to achieve this? Also, briefly
        explain what are the key and value pairs you receive as input to
        a map task and what methods are responsible for producing these
        pairs?

    -   Do you think this particular implementation will work if the
        input files are larger than the default HDFS block size? Briefly
        explain why. \[Hint: you can test what will happen by
        concatenating the same input file multiple times to create a
        larger input file in the resources/blast_input folder\]

    -   If you wanted to extend this program such that all output files
        will be concatenated into a single file, what key and value
        pairs would you need to emit from the map task? Also, how would
        you use these in the reduce that you would need to add?

-   The 4 output FASTA files: celllines_1.fa to celllines_4.fa.

Introduction
------------

Hadoop-Blast is an advanced Hadoop program which helps BLAST, a
bioinformatics application, to utilize the computing capability of
Hadoop. This exercise shows the details of its implementation, and
provides an example of how to handle similar approaches in other
applications.

BLAST is one of the most widely used bioinformatics applications written
in C++. The version we are using is v2.2.23, which houses new features
and better performance. The database used in the following settings is a
subset of a full 8.5GB (nr) database; its full name is Non-redundant
protein sequence database. Optionally, for more details on how to run
the BLAST binary, please see Big Data for Science tutorial page for
Blast Installation \[NOT required for the assignment\].

In this exercise, we have provided a sketch code which contains just one
java class for you to implement:

-   RunnerMap.java: The pleasingly-parallel/map-only Map class which
    takes the prepackaged Blast (v2.2.23) Binary Program and optimized
    database from Hadoop's Distributed Cache, then executes BLAST binary
    as java external process with the assigned FASTA file. These are
    passed as key-value pairs of **(filename, filepath on HDFS)**
    handled by a provided customized Hadoop MapReduce InputFormat
    DataFileInputFormat.java.

The detail dataflow can be seen in
Figure [\[fig:blastdataflow\]](#fig:blastdataflow){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:blastdataflow"}. You will implement the RunnerMap.java,
which copies the distributed cache and assigned FASTA file to local,
then run the BLAST binary with correct parameters.

Normally, for any Hadoop MapReduce program, input data is uploaded and
stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) before computation
in order to generate **(key, value)** pairs to the mapper. Initially,
the BLAST input data is a set of FASTA files located in the local file
system. Then it will be uploaded to the HDFS and distributed across the
compute nodes. Hadoop framework reads the application records from HDFS
with the InputFormat interface and generates **(key, value)** pair input
streams; here, we use a provided customized Hadoop MapReduce InputFormat
DataFileInputFormat.java to generate key-value pairs of **(filename,
filepath on HDFS)**. For this Hadoop Blast program, the map function
initially sets up the distributed cache and generates the two absolute
location filepaths for Blast binary and Blast Database. Afterwards it
copies the assigned FASTA file to local disk by looking up the file from
HDFS and generating an absolute filepath. Once this is accomplished and
file dependencies are stored in the local disk, we call an external java
process and execute the Blast binary with the correct parameters.
Finally, the output FASTA file of Blast binary will be uploaded back to
HDFS.

Sketch for Hadoop Blast
-----------------------

You need to complete one file in the provided package inside
\"cgl/hadoop/apps/runner\": RunnerMap.java. Code snapshots are shown
next.

INPUT section/icloud/assignment/exercise3/RunnerMap.java

In addition, if you need to understand the dataflow and main program,
please look into the DataAnalysis.java.

INPUT: section/icloud/assignment/exercise3/DataAnalysis.java

Edit
----

The sketch code is stored within the provided VirtualBox image. Use
linux text editor vi/vim to add your code.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ cd /root/MoocHomeworks/HadoopBlast/
$ vim src/cgl/hadoop/apps/runner/RunnerMap.java
```

Compile and run your code
-------------------------

Use the same one-click script compileAndExecHadoopBlast.sh as in prior
homework. Standard error messages such as compile errors, execution
errors, etc. will be redirected on the screen. Follow the same debugging
format.

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ cd /root/MoocHomeworks/HadoopBlast/
$ ./compileAndExecHadoopBlast.sh
```

View the result
---------------

The result is generated at
/root/MoocHomeworks/HadoopBlast/output/HDFS_blast_output . There
should be 4 output FASTA files with .fa extension

``` {.bash language="bash"}
$ cd /root/MoocHomeworks/HadoopBlast/output/HDFS_blast_output
$ ls
```
