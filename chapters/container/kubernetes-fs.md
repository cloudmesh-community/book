# Using Kubernetes on FutureSystems {#sec:kub-fs}

This section introduces you on how to use the Kubernetes cluster
on FutureSystems. Currently we have deployed kubernetes on our
cluster called *echo*.


## Getting Access

You will need an account on FutureSystems and upload the ssh key to
the FutureSystems portal from the computer from which you want to
login to echo. To verify, if you have access try to see if you can log
into victor.futuresystems.org. You need to be a member of a valid
FutureSystems project.

For Fall 2018 classes at IU you need to be in the following project:

<https://portal.futuresystems.org/project/553>

If you have verified that you have access to the victor, you can now try
to login to the kubernetes cluster head node with the same username
and key. Run these first on your **local machine** to set the username and
login host:

```bash
$ export ECHOK8S=149.165.150.85
$ export FS_USER=<put your futersystem account name here>
```

Then you can login to the kubernetes head node by running:

```bash
$ ssh $FS_USER@$ECHOK8S
```

**NOTE: If you have access to victor but not the kubernetes system, your
project may not have been authorized to access the kubernetes cluster.
Send a ticket to FutureSystems ticket system to request this.**

Once you are logged in to the kubernetes cluster head node you can run
commands on the **remote echo kubernetes machine** (all commands shown in next
except stated otherwise) to use the kubernetes installation there.
First try to run:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
```

This will let you know if you have access to kubernetes and verifies
if the kubectl command works for you. Naturally it will also list the pods.

## Example Use

The following command runs an image called Nginx with two replicas, Nginx is
a popular web sever which is well known as a high performance load balancer.

```bash
$ kubectl run nginx --replicas=2 --image=nginx --port=80
```

As a result of this one deployment was created, and two PODs are
created and started. If you encounter and error stating that the deployment
already exists when executing the previous command that is because the
command has already been executed. To see the deployment, please use the
command, this command should work even if you noticed the error mentioned.

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment
```

This will result in the following output

```text
    NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx     2         2         2            2           7m
```

To see the pods please use the command

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
```

This will result in the following output

```text
    NAME                   READY STATUS  RESTARTS AGE
    nginx-7587c6fdb6-4jnh6 1/1   Running 0        7m
    nginx-7587c6fdb6-pxpsz 1/1   Running 0        7m
```

If we want to see more detailed information we cn use the command

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
```

```text
    NAME                   READY STATUS  RESTARTS AGE IP        NODE
    nginx-75...-4jnh6 1/1   Running 0        8m  192.168.56.2   e003
    nginx-75...-pxpsz 1/1   Running 0        8m  192.168.255.66 e005
```

Please note the IP address field. Make sure you are using the IP address that
is listed when you execute the command since the IP address may have changed.
Now if we try to access the nginx homepage with wget (or curl)

```bash
$ wget 192.168.56.2
```

we see the following output:

```text
    --2018-02-20 14:05:59--  http://192.168.56.2/
    Connecting to 192.168.56.2:80... connected.
    HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
    Length: 612 [text/html]
    Saving to: 'index.html'

    index.html    100%[=========>]     612  --.-KB/s    in 0s

    2018-02-20 14:05:59 (38.9 MB/s) - 'index.html' saved [612/612]
```

It verifies that the specified image was running, and it is accessible
from within the cluster.

Next we need to start thinking about how we
access this web server from outside the cluster. We can explicitly
exposing the service with the following command. You can change the name that
is set using `--name` to what you want. Given that is adheres to the
naming standards. If the name you enter is already in the system your command
 will return an error saying the service already exists.

```bash
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=NodePort --name=abc-nginx-ext
```

We will see the response

```text
$ service "nginx-external" exposed
```

To find the exposed ip addresses, we simply issue the command

```bash
$ kubectl get svc
```

We se something like this

```text
    NAME          TYPE      CLUSTER-IP    EXTERN PORT(S)      AGE
                                          AL-IP
    kubernetes    ClusterIP 10.96.0.1     <none> 443/TCP      8h
    abc-nginx-ext NodePort  10.110.177.35 <none> 80:31386/TCP 3s
```

please note that we have given a unique name.

---

For IU students:

You could use your username or if you use one of our classes your
hid. The number part will typically be sufficient.  For class users
that do not use the hid in the name we will terminate all instances
without notification. In addition, we like you explicitly to add
"-ext" to every container that is exposed to the internet. Naturally
we want you to shut down such services if they are not in use. Failure
to do so may result in termination of the service without notice, and
in the worst case revocation of your privileges to use *echo*.

---

In our example you will find the port on which our service is exposed
and remapped to. We find the port **31386** in the value
**80:31386/TCP** in the ports column for the running container.

Now if we visit this URL, which is the public IP of the head node
followed by the exposed port number, from a browser on **your local
machine**

```text
    http://149.165.150.85:31386
```

you should see the 'Welcome to nginx' page.

Once you have done all the work needed using the service you can delete it using
the following command.

```bash
$ kubectl delete service <service-name>
```
