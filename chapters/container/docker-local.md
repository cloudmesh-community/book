# Running Docker Locally

:warning: Please verify if the instructions are still up to date. Rapid changes
could mean they can be outdated quickly. Also we assume the ubuntu instalations
may have changed and may be different between 18.04 and 19.04.

The official installation documentation for docker can be found by
visiting the following Web page:

* <https://www.docker.com/community-edition>

Here you will find a variety of packages, one of which will hopefully
suitable for your operating system. The supported operating systems
currently include:

* OSX, Windows, Centos, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, AWS, Azure

Please chose the one most suitable for you. For your convenience we
provide you with installation instructions for OSX
(Section [Docker on OSX](#s:docker-osx){reference-type="ref"
reference="s:docker-osx"}), Windows 10
(Section [Docker on Windows](#s:docker-windows){reference-type="ref"
reference="s:docker-windows"}) and Ubuntu
(Section [Docker on ubuntu](#s:docker-ubuntu){reference-type="ref"
reference="s:docker-ubuntu"}).

## Instillation for OSX

The docker community edition for OSX can be found at the following link

* <https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac>

We recommend that at this time you get the version *Docker CE for MAC
(stable)*

* <https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg>

Clicking on the link will download a dmg file to your machine, that you
than will need to install by double clicking and allowing access to the
dmg file. Upon installation a `whale` in the top status bar shows that
Docker is running, and you can access it via a terminal.

## Installation for Ubuntu

In order to install Docker community edition for Ubuntu, you first have
to register the repository from where you can download it. This can be
achieved as follows:

```bash
local$ sudo apt-get update
local$ sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
local$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
local$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
local$ sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   local$(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

Now that you have configured the repository location, you can install it
after you have updated the operating system. The update and install is
done as follows:


```bash
local$ sudo apt-get update
local$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce
local$ sudo apt-get update
```
Once installed execute the following command to make sure the installation is
 done properly

 ```bash
 local$ sudo systemctl status docker
 ```

 This should give you an output similar to the next.

 ```bash
  docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Wed 2018-10-03 13:02:04 EDT; 15min ago
      Docs: https://docs.docker.com
  Main PID: 6663 (dockerd)
     Tasks: 39

 ```

## Installation for Windows 10

Docker needs Microsoft's Hyper-V to be enabled, but it will impact running the virtual machines

Steps to Install

* Download Docker for Windows(Community Edition) from the following link
  <https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe>
* Follow the Wizard steps in the installer
* Launch docker
* Docker usually lauches automatically during windows startup.

## Testing the Install

To test if it works execute the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
local$ docker version
```

You should see an output similar to

    docker version

    Client:
      Version:      17.03.1-ce
      API version:  1.27
      Go version:   go1.7.5
      Git commit:   c6d412e
      Built:        Tue Mar 28 00:40:02 2017
      OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64

    Server:
      Version:      17.03.1-ce
      API version:  1.27 (minimum version 1.12)
      Go version:   go1.7.5
      Git commit:   c6d412e
      Built:        Fri Mar 24 00:00:50 2017
      OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
      Experimental: true

To see if you can run a container use

```bash
local$ docker run hello-world
```

Once executed you should see an output similar to

```bash
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
78445dd45222: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:c5515758d4c5e1e838e9cd307f6c6a .....
Status: Downloaded newer image for
        hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears
to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following
steps:

1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image
   from the Docker Hub.
3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that
   image which runs the executable that produces the
   output you are currently reading.
4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker
   client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu
container with:

local$ docker run -it ubuntu bash
