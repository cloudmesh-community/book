This section covers an introduction to containers that is split up into
four parts. We discuss microservices, serverless computing, Docker, and
kubernetes.

## Motivation - Microservices

We discuss the motivation for containers and contrast them to virtual
machines. Additionally we provide a motivation for containers as they
can be used to microservices.

## Motivation - Serverless Computing


We enhance our motivation while contrasting containers and microservices
while relating them to serverless computing. We anticipate that
serverless computing will increase in importance over the next years

## Docker

In order for us to use containers, we go beyond the historical
motivation that was introduced in a previous section and focus on Docker
a predominant technology for containers on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Docker and Kubernetes

We continue our discussion about docker and introduce kubernetes,
allowing us to run multiple containers on multiple servers building a
cluster of containers.
