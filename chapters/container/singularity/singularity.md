# Running Singularity Containers on Comet

This section was copied from

* <https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/tutorials/singularity.html>

and modified. To use it you will need an account on comet which can be
obtained via XSEDE. In case you use this material as part of a class
please contact your teacher for more information.

## Background

What is Singularity?

> "Singularity enables users to have full control of their
> environment.  Singularity containers can be used to package entire
> scientific workflows, software and libraries, and even data. This
> means that you don't have to ask your cluster admin to install
> anything for you - you can put it in a Singularity container and
> run."

**[from the Singularity web site at <http://singularity.lbl.gov/>]**

There are numerous good tutorials on how to install and run Singularity
on Linux, OS X, or Windows so we won't go into much detail on that
process here. In this tutorial you will learn how to run Singularity on
Comet. First we will review how to access a compute node on Comet and
provide a simple example to help get you started. There are numerous
tutorial on how to get started with Singularity, but there are some
details specific to running Singularity on Comet which are not covered
in those tutorials. This tutorial assumes you already have an account on
Comet. You will also need access to a basic set of example files to get
started. SDSC hosts a Github repository containing a 'Hello world!"
example which you may clone with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hpcdevops/singularity-hello-world.git
```

## Why Singularity?

Listed next is a typical list of commands you would need to issue in order to
implement a functional Python installation for scientific research:

```
COMMAND=apt-get -y install libx11-dev
COMMAND=apt-get install build-essential python-libdev
COMMAND=apt-get install build-essentyial openmpi-dev
COMMAND=apt-get install cmake
COMMAND=apt-get install g++
COMMAND=apt-get install git-lfs
COMMAND=apt-get install libXss.so.1
COMMAND=apt-get install libgdal1-dev libproj-dev
COMMAND=apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev libjsoncpp0
COMMAND=apt-get install libmpich-dev --user
COMMAND=apt-get install libpthread-stubs0 libpthread-stubs0-dev libx11-dev libx11-d
COMMAND=apt-get install libudev0:i386
COMMAND=apt-get install numpy
COMMAND=apt-get install python-matplotlib
COMMAND=apt-get install python3`
```

Singularity allows you to avoid this time-consuming series of steps by
packaging these commands in a re-usable and editable script, allowing
you to quickly, easily, and repeatedly implement a custom container
designed specifically for your analytical needs.

## Hands-On Tutorials

The following tutorial includes links to asciinema video
tutorials created by SDSC HPC Systems Manager, Trevor Cooper
which allow you to see the console interactivity and output in
detail. Look for the ![Video](images/video.png) icon like the one shown to the right
corresponding to the task you are currently working on.


## Downloading & Installing Singularity

* Download & Unpack Singularity
* Configure & Build Singularity
* Install & Test Singularity

### Download & Unpack Singularity

First we download and upack the source using the following commands
(assuming your user name is `test_user` and you are working on your
local computer with super user privileges):

```bash
[test_user@localhost ~]$ wget https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/
releases/download/2.5.1/singularity-2.5.1.tar.gz tar -zxf singularity-2.5.1.tar.gz
```

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - download source and unpack in VirtualBox VM (CentOS 7)](https://asciinema.org/a/12986)

If the file is successfully extracted, you should be able to view the
results:

```bash
[test_user@localhost ~]$ cd singularity-2.5.1/
[test_user@localhost singularity-2.5.1]$ ls
```


### Configure & Build Singularity


[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - configure and build in VirtualBox VM (CentOS 7)](https://asciinema.org/a/129867)

Next we configure and build the package. To configure, enter the following
command (we will leave out the command prompts):

```bash
./configure
```

To build, issue the following command:

`make`

This may take several seconds depending on your computer.

### Install & Test Singularity

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - install and test in VirtualBox VM (CentOS 7)](https://asciinema.org/a/129868)

To complete the installation enter:

`sudo make install`

You should be prompted to enter your admin password.

Once the installation is completed, you can check to see if it succeeded
in a few different ways:

`which singularity` `singularity -version`

You can also run a selftest with the following command:

`singularity selftest`

The output should look something like:

`+ sh -c test -f /usr/local/etc/singularity/singularity.conf (retval=0) OK  + test -u /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/action-suid (retval=0) OK  + test -u /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/create-suid (retval=0) OK  + test -u /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/expand-suid (retval=0) OK  + test -u /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/export-suid (retval=0) OK  + test -u /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/import-suid (retval=0) OK  + test -u /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/mount-suid (retval=0) OK `

## Building Singularity Containers {#sec:building-singularity-containers}

The process of building a Singularity container consists of a few
distinct steps as follows.

- Upgrading Singularity (if needed)
- Create an Empty Container
- Import into Container
- Shell into Container
- Write into Container
- Bootstrap Container



We will go through each of these steps in detail.

### Upgrading Singularity

We recommend building containers using the same version of Singularity,
2.5.1, as exists on Comet. This is a 2 step process.

**Step 1: run the next script to remove your existing Singularity:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# A cleanup script to remove Singularity

sudo rm -rf /usr/local/libexec/singularity
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/etc/singularity
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/include/singularity
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/singularity
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/var/lib/singularity/
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/singularity
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/run-singularity
sudo rm /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/singularity
sudo rm /usr/local/man/man1/singularity.1
```

**Step 2: run the following script to install Singularity 2.5.1:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# A build script for Singularity (http://singularity.lbl.gov/)

declare -r SINGULARITY_NAME='singularity'
declare -r SINGULARITY_VERSION='2.5.1'
declare -r SINGULARITY_PREFIX='/usr/local'
declare -r SINGULARITY_CONFIG_DIR='/etc'

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python dh-autoreconf build-essential debootstrap

cd ../
tar -xzvf "${PWD}/tarballs/${SINGULARITY_NAME}-${SINGULARITY_VERSION}.tar.gz"
cd "${SINGULARITY_NAME}-${SINGULARITY_VERSION}"
./configure --prefix="${SINGULARITY_PREFIX}" --sysconfdir="${SINGULARITY_CONFIG_DIR}"
make
sudo make install
```



Create an Empty Container
-------------------------

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - create container](https://asciinema.org/a/130106)

To create an empty Singularity container, you simply issue the following command:

`singularity create centos7.img`

This will create a CentOS 7 container with a default size of \~805 Mb.
Depending on what additional configurations you plan to make to the
container, this size may or may not be big enough. To specify a
particular size, such as \~4 Gb, include the -s parameter, as shown in
the following command:

`singularity create -s 4096 centos7.img`

To view the resulting image in a directory listing, enter the following:

`ls`

Import Into a Singularity Container
-----------------------------------

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - import Docker image](https://asciinema.org/a/130107)

Next, we will import a Docker image into our empty Singularity container:

`singularity import centos7.img docker://centos:7`



Shell Into a Singularity Container
----------------------------------

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - shell into container](https://asciinema.org/a/130109)

Once the container actually contains a CentOS 7 installation, you can 'shell'
into it with the following:

`singularity shell centos7.img`

Once you enter the container you should see a different command prompt.
At this new prompt, try typing:

`whoami `

Your user id should be identical to your user id outside the container.
However, the operating system will probably be different. Try issuing
the following command from inside the container to see what the OS
version is:

`cat /etc/*-release`

Write Into a Singularity Container
----------------------------------

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - write into container](https://asciinema.org/a/130110)

Next, let's trying writing into the container (as root):

`sudo /usr/local/bin/singularity shell -w centos7.img`

You should be prompted for your password, and then you should see
something like the following:

`Invoking an interactive shell within the container...`

Next, let's create a script within the container so we can use it to
test the ability of the container to execute shell scripts:

`vi hello_world.sh`

The previous command assumes you know the vi editor. Enter the following
text into the script, save it, and quit the vi editor:

`#!/bin/bash echo "Hello, World!"`

You may need to change the permissions on the script so it can be
executable:

`chmod +x hello_world.sh`

Try running the script manually:

`./hello_world.sh`

The output should be:

`Hello, World!`



Bootstrapping a Singularity Container
-------------------------------------

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - bootstrapping a container](https://asciinema.org/a/130111)

Bootstrapping a Singularity container allows you to use what is called a 'definitions
file' so you can reproduce the resulting container configurations on
demand.

Let us say you want to create a container with Ubuntu, but you may want
to create variations on the configurations without having to repeat a
long list of commands manually. First, we need our definitions file.
Given next is the contents of a definitions file which should suffice for our
purposes.

```bash
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest
%runscript
exec echo "The runscript is the containers default runtime command!"

%files
/home/testuser/ubuntu.def /data/ubuntu.def

%environment
VARIABLE=HELLOWORLD
Export VARIABLE
%labels
AUTHOR testuser@sdsc.edu

%post
apt-get update && apt-get -y install python3 git wget
mkdir /data
echo "The post section is where you can install and configure your container."
```

To bootstrap your container, first we need to create an empty container.

`singularity create -s 4096 ubuntu.img`

Now, we simply need to issue the following command to configure our
container with Ubuntu:

`sudo /usr/local/bin/singularity bootstrap ./ubuntu.img ./ubuntu.def`

This may take a while to complete. In principle, you can accomplish
the same result by manually issuing each of the commands contained in
the script file, but why do that when you can use bootstrapping to
save time and avoid errors.

If all goes according to plan, you should then be able to shell into
your new Ubuntu container.


## Running Singularity Containers on Comet{#sec:running-singularity-containers}

Of course, the purpose of this tutorial is to enable you to use the San
Diego Supercomputer Center's Comet supercomputer to run your jobs. This
assumes you have an account on Comet already. If you do not have an
account on Comet and you feel you can justify the need for such an
account (i.e. your research is limited by the limited compute power you
have in your government-funded research lab), you can request a 'Startup
Allocation' through the XSEDE User Portal:

<https://portal.xsede.org/allocations-overview#types-trial>

You may create a free account on the XUP if you do not already have one
and then proceed to submit an allocation request at the previously given link.

NOTE: SDSC provides a
[Comet User Guide](http://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html)
to help get you started with Comet. Learn more about The San Diego
Supercomputer Center at <http://www.sdsc.edu>.

This tutorial walks you through the following four steps towards running
your first Singularity container on Comet:

- Transfer the Container to Comet
- Run the Container on Comet
- Allocate Resources to Run the Container
- Integrate the Container with Slurm
- Use existing Comet Containers



### Transfer the Container to Comet

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - transfer container to Comet
](https://asciinema.org/a/130195)

Once you have created your container on your local system, you will
need to transfer it to Comet. There are multiple ways to do this and
it can take a varying amount of time depending on its size and your
network connection speeds.

To do this, we will use scp (secure copy). If you have a Globus account
and your containers are more than 4 Gb you will probably want to use
that file transfer method instead of scp.

Browse to the directory containing the container. Copy the container to
your scratch directory on Comet. By issuing the following command:

`scp ./centos7.img comet.sdsc.edu:/oasis/scratch/comet/test_user/temp_project/`

The container is \~805 Mb so it should not take too long, hopefully.



### Run the Container on Comet

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - run container on Comet](https://asciinema.org/a/130196)

Once the file is transferred, login to Comet (assuming your Comet user
is named `test_user`):

`ssh test_user@comet.sdsc.edu`

Navigate to your scratch directory on Comet, which should be something
like:

`[test_user@comet-ln3 ~]$ cd /oasis/scratch/comet/test_user/temp_project/`

Next, you should submit a request for an interactive session on one of
Comet's compute, debug, or shared nodes.

`[test_user@comet-ln3 ~]$ srun --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -p compute -t 01:00:00 --wait 0 /bin/bash `

Once your request is approved your command prompt should reflect the new
node id.

Before you can run your container you will need to load the Singularity
module (if you are unfamiliar with modules on Comet, you may want to
review the Comet User Guide). The command to load Singularity on Comet
is:

`[test_user@comet-ln3 ~]$ module load singularity`

You may issue the previous command from any directory on Comet. Recall that
we added a `hello_world.sh` script to our centos7.img container. Let us
try executing that script with the following command:

` [test_user@comet-ln3 ~]$ singularity exec /oasis/scratch/comet/test_user/temp_project/singularity/centos7.img /hello_world.sh `

If all goes well,Â you should see *Hello, World!* in the console output.
You might also see some warnings pertaining to non-existent bind points.
You can resolve this by adding some additional lines to your definitions
file before you build your container. We did not do that for this
tutorial, but you would use a command like the following in your
definitions file:

`# create bind points for SDSC HPC environment mkdir /oasis /scratch/ /comet /temp_project`

You will find additional examples located in the following locations on
Comet:

`/share/apps/examples/SI2017/Singularity `

and

`/share/apps/examples/SINGULARITY`



### Allocate Resources to Run the Container

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - allocate resources to run container
 ](https://asciinema.org/a/130197)

It is best to avoid working on Comet's login nodes since they can
become a performance bottleneck not only for you but for all other
users. You should rather allocate resources specific for
computationally-intensive jobs. To allocate a 'compute node' for your
user on Comet, issue the following command:

`[test_user@comet-ln3 ~]$ salloc -N 1 -t 00:10:00`

This allocation requests a single node (-N 1) for a total time of 10
minutes (-t 00:10:00). Once your request has been approved, your
computer node name should be displayed, e.g. comet-17-12.

Now you may login to this node:

`[test_user@comet-ln3 ~]$ ssh comet-17-12`

Notice that the command prompt has now changed to reflect the fact that
you are on a compute node and not a login node.

`[test_user@comet-06-04 ~]$ `

Next, load the Singularity module, shell into the container, and execute
the `hello_world.sh` script:

`[test_user@comet-06-04 ~]$ module load singularity [test_user@comet-06-04 ~]$ singularity shell centos7.img [test_user@comet-06-04 ~]$ ./hello_world.sh`

If all goes well, you should see *Hello, World!* in the console output.



### Integrate the Container with Slurm

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - run container on Comet via Slurm](https://asciinema.org/a/130218)

Of course, most users simply want to submit their jobs to the Comet
queue and let it run to completion and go on to other things while
waiting. Slurm is the job manager for Comet.

Given next is a job script (which we will name
`singularity_mvapich2_hellow.run`) which will submit your Singularity
container to the Comet queue and run a program, hellow.c (written in C
using MPI and provided as part of the examples with the mvapich2 default
installation).

` #!/bin/bash `` #SBATCH --job-name="singularity_mvapich2_hellow"  #SBATCH --output="singularity_mvapich2_hellow.%j.out"  #SBATCH --error="singularity_mvapich2_hellow.%j.err"  #SBATCH --nodes=2  #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24  #SBATCH --time=00:10:00  #SBATCH --export=all `
` module load mvapich2_ib singularity `

` CONTAINER=/oasis/scratch/comet/$USER/temp_project/singularity/centos7-mvapich2.img `

` mpirun singularity exec ${CONTAINER} /usr/bin/hellow `

The previous script requests 2 nodes and 24 tasks per node with a wall time
of 10 minutes. Notice that two modules are loaded (see the line
beginning with 'module'), one for Singularity and one for MPI. An
environment variable 'CONTAINER' is also defined to make it a little
easier to manage long reusable text strings such as file paths.

You may need to add a line specifying with allocation to be used for
this job. When you are ready to submit the job to the Comet queue, issue
the following command:

`[test_user@comet-06-04 ~]$ sbatch -p debug ./singularity_mvapich2_hellow.run`

To view the status of your job in the Comet queue, issue the following:

`[test_user@comet-06-04 ~]$ squeue -u test_user`

When the job is complete, view the output which should be written to the
output file `singularity_mvapich2_hellow.%j.out` where `%j` is the job ID
(let's say the job ID is 1000001):

`[test_user@comet-06-04 ~]$ more singularity_mvapich2_hellow.1000001.out`

The output should look something like the following:

```
Hello world from process 28 of 48
Hello world from process 29 of 48
Hello world from process 30 of 48
Hello world from process 31 of 48
Hello world from process 32 of 48
Hello world from process 33 of 48
Hello world from process 34 of 48
Hello world from process 35 of 48
Hello world from process 36 of 48
Hello world from process 37 of 48
Hello world from process 38 of 48
```


### Use Existing Comet Containers

SDSC User Support staff, Marty Kandes, has built several custom
Singularity containers designed specifically for the Comet environment.

[Learn more about these containers for Comet](about_comet_singularity_containers.html).

![No](images/no.png) the html sholuld be converted to markdown. use pandoc. This also
needs to be downloaded from the SDSC page

![No](images/no.png) what is this?

[News Flash!]{style="color: #d31820; font-family: Tauri, sans-serif; font-size: 30px;"}

Now there's an easier way to run a Singularity container on Comet ...

![No](images/no.png) I think this need sto be updated to the just easier way?

### PULL IT!

[![Video](images/video.png) Singularity - pull from singularity-hub on Comet](https://asciinema.org/a/129906)

Comet now supports the capability to pull a container directly from any properly
configured remote singularity hub. For example, the following command
can pull a container from the hpcdevops singularity hub straight to an
empty container located on Comet:

`[test_user@comet-06-04 ~]$ singularity pull shub://hpcdevops/singularity-hello-world:master`

The resulting container should be named something like
singularity-hello-world.img.

Learn more about Singularity Hubs and container collections at:

<https://singularity-hub.org/collections>

That's it! Congratulations! You should now be able to run Singularity
containers on Comet either interactively or through the job queue. We
hope you found this tutorial useful. Please contact <support@xsede.org>
with any questions you might have. Your Comet-related questions will be
routed to the amazing SDSC Support Team.

## Using Tensorflow With Singularity

One of the more common advantages of using Singularity is the ability to
use pre-built containers for specific applications which may be
difficult to install and maintain by yourself, such as Tensorflow. The
most common example of a Tensorflow application is character recognition
using the MNIST dataset. You can learn more about this dataset at
<http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>.

XSEDE's Comet supercomputer supports Singularity and provides several
pre-built container which run Tensorflow. Given next is an example batch
script which runs a Tensorflow job within a Singularity container on
Comet. Copy this script and paste it into a shell script named
`mnist_tensorflow_example.sb`.

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="TensorFlow"
#SBATCH --output="TensorFlow.%j.%N.out"
#SBATCH --partition=gpu-shared
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=6
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:k80:1
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00
```

## Run the job

```
module load singularity
singularity exec
/share/apps/gpu/singularity/sdsc_ubuntu_gpu_tflow.img lsb_release
-a
singularity exec
/share/apps/gpu/singularity/sdsc_ubuntu_gpu_tflow.img python -m
tensorflow.models.image.mnist.convolutional
```

To submit the script to Comet, first you'll need to request a compute
node with the following command (replace account with your XSEDE account
number):

```
[test_user@comet-ln3 ~]$ srun --account=your_account_code --partition=gpu-shared --gres=gpu:1 --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 -t 00:30:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash
```


To submit a job to the Comet queue, issue the following command:

```
[test_user@comet-06-04 ~]$ sbatch mnist_tensorflow_example.sb
```

When the job is done you should see an output file in your output
directory containing something resembling the following:
