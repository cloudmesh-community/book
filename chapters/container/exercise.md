# Exercises :o:


## Docker Swarm Section

Develop a section that deploys a Docker Swarm cluster on a number of
ubuntu machines. Note that this may actually be easier as docker and
docker swarm are distributed with recent versions of ubuntu. Just in
case we are providing a link to an effort we found to install docker
swarm. However we have not checked it or identified if it is useful.

## Docker Swarm on Google Compute Engine

Develop a section that deploys a Docker Swarm cluster on Google Compute
Engine. Note that this may actually be easier as docker and docker swarm
are distributed with recent versions of ubuntu. Just in case we are
providing a link to an effort we found to install docker swarm. However

## Single Node Hadoop

At

<https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html>

you will find a comprehensive installation instruction that sets up a
hadoop cluster on a single node.

\(a) Create a Dockerfile that deploys hadoop in a container

\(b) Develop sample applications and tests to test your cluster. You can
use wordcount or similar.

## Single Node Hadoop

At

<https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html>

you will find a comprehensive installation instruction that sets up a
hadoop cluster in a distributed environment, can you use this set of
instructions aor identify other resources on the internet that allow the
creation of a hadoop cluster on kubernetes. You can use docker compose
for this.

\(a) Create docker compose and Dockerfiles that deploys hadoop in
kubernetes

\(b) Develop sample applications and tests to test your cluster. You can
use wordcount or similar.

## Spark Cluster

Develop a high quality section that installs a spark cluster in
kubernetes. Test your deployment on minikube but also Futuresystems
echo.

You may want to get inspired from the talk *Scalable Spark Deployment
using Kubernetes*:
