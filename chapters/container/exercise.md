# Exercises


E.Docker.Swarm.1: Documentation

> Develop a section in the handbook that deploys a Docker Swarm cluster 
  on a number of
  ubuntu machines. Note that this may actually be easier as docker and
  docker swarm are distributed with recent versions of ubuntu. Just in
  case we are providing a link to an effort we found to install docker
  swarm. However we have not checked it or identified if it is useful.

E.Docker.Swarm.2: Google Compute Engine

> Develop a section that deploys a Docker Swarm cluster on Google Compute
  Engine. Note that this may actually be easier as docker and docker swarm
  are distributed with recent versions of ubuntu. Just in case we are
  providing a link to an effort we found to install docker swarm. However
  we have not checked it or identified if it is useful.

E.SingleNodeHadoop:

> Setup a single node hadoop environment.

  This includes:

  * (a).Create a Dockerfile that deploys hadoop in a container
  * (b).Develop sample applications and tests to test your cluster. You can
use wordcount or similar.
  
  you will find a comprehensive installation instruction that sets up a
  hadoop cluster on a single node at
  
  * <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html>

E.MultiNodeHadoop:

> Setup a hadoop cluster in a distributed environment.

  This includes:

  * (a).Create docker compose and Dockerfiles that deploys hadoop in kubernetes
  * (b).Develop sample applications and tests to test your cluster. You can
use wordcount or similar.
  
  you will find a comprehensive installation instruction that sets up a
  hadoop cluster in a distributed environment at
  
  * <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html>
  
  You can use this set of
  instructions or identify other resources on the internet that allow the
  creation of a hadoop cluster on kubernetes. Alternatively you can use docker compose
  for this exercise.


E.SparkCluster: Documentation

> Develop a high quality section that installs a spark cluster in
  kubernetes. Test your deployment on minikube and also on Futuresystems
  echo.

  You may want to get inspired from the talk *Scalable Spark Deployment
  using Kubernetes*:
