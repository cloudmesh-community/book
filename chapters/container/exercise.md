# Exercises


E.Docker.Swarm.1: Documentation

> Develop a section in the handbook that deploys a Docker Swarm cluster
> on a number of
> ubuntu machines. Note that this may actually be easier as docker and
> docker swarm are distributed with recent versions of ubuntu. Just in
> case we are providing a link to an effort we found to install docker
> swarm. However we have not checked it or identified if it is useful.

E.Docker.Swarm.2: Google Compute Engine

> Develop a section that deploys a Docker Swarm cluster on Google Compute
> Engine. Note that this may actually be easier as docker and docker swarm
> are distributed with recent versions of ubuntu. Just in case we are
> providing a link to an effort we found to install docker swarm. However
> we have not checked it or identified if it is useful.

E.SingleNodeHadoop:

> Setup a single node hadoop environment.

> This includes:

> 1. Create a Dockerfile that deploys hadoop in a container
> 2. Develop sample applications and tests to test your cluster. You can
>      use wordcount or similar.
>
> you will find a comprehensive installation instruction that sets up a
> hadoop cluster on a single node at
>
> * <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html>

E.MultiNodeHadoop:

> Setup a hadoop cluster in a distributed environment.

> This includes:

> 1. Create docker compose and Dockerfiles that deploys hadoop in kubernetes
> 2. Develop sample applications and tests to test your cluster. You can
>    use wordcount or similar.
>
> you will find a comprehensive installation instruction that sets up a
> hadoop cluster in a distributed environment at
>
> * <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html>
>
> You can use this set of
> instructions or identify other resources on the internet that allow the
> creation of a hadoop cluster on kubernetes. Alternatively you can use docker compose
> for this exercise.


E.SparkCluster: Documentation

> Develop a high quality section that installs a spark cluster in
> kubernetes. Test your deployment on minikube and also on Futuresystems
> echo.
>
> You may want to get inspired from the talk *Scalable Spark Deployment
> using Kubernetes*:
