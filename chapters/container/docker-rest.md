# Docker Flask REST Service

We discuss how to use Docker to deploy a REST service designed using
Python Flask.

# Creating the Image

```console
$ mkdir -p ~/cloudmesh/containers/docker-flask
$ cd ~/cloudmesh/containers/docker-flask
```

In this directory we will have the following file and directory
structure, where directories are indicated with a `/` at the end

```
~/cloudmesh/containers/docker-flask
    - Dockerfile
    - requirements.txt
    - app/
        - main.py
```

Include the following content in the `requirements.txt` file.

```
Flask==0.11.1
```

To fulfill the requirements, please run the  command

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next we are going to create the Dockerfile which includes all the
instructions for the deployment of the REST API on docker. This file
includes the following content:

> ![Warning](images/warning.png) *We do not know if this is a good image as this was
> originally contributed by a student. We would prefer if the image is
> created from scratch by a dockerfile. Running arbitrary docker images
> on your machine could pose a security risk.*

```
FROM tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask:flask
COPY ./app /app
```

The Dockerfile contains the `FROM` command which downloads a parent
image in which we install the rest of our services. The image is
hosted on Dockerhub


So in this case for the ease of the task and to keep it simple with
minimum packages we are going to select an image including nginx, flask
and uWSGI.

1.  Nginx: An open source software for web serving capability.

2.  Flask: REST API package in Python

3.  uWSGI: A server and one of the protocols implemented in WSGI which
    is a protocol used for pure HTTP communications and load balancing.

So this image includes everything we need to work on this tutorial.

COPY: Here it will copy content from app folder created in local machine
to the Docker container.

Now the Dockerfile is completed and we have everything needed to build a
docker image.

Next we create the main.py file inside the app folder with the
following content.

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask import jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    data = {"message": "Hey I am using Docker!")
    return flask.jsonify(**data)

@app.route("/cloudmesh/cpu")
def get_cpu():
    data = {"cpu": "icore7")
    return flask.jsonify(**data)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="127.0.0.1", debug=True, port=80)
```

To build the container, please use the commands

```console
$ cd ~/cloudmesh/containers/docker-flask
$ docker build -t sample-flask-rest-app .
```

If it builds successfully, you will get the following response

> ![Warning](images/warning.png) *this image may not work and may not be secure so do not use
> this example!*

```console
$ docker build -t sample-flask-rest-app .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  19.15MB
Step 1/2: FROM tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask:python3.7
 ---> ec43f17def9a
Step 2/2: COPY ./app /app
 ---> e8eb1bff86b8
Successfully built e8eb1bff86b8
Successfully tagged sample-flask-rest-app:latest

Note: Changing any content inside the app folder must be
      updated in the container by rebuilding the image.
```


## Running the Docker Image

Run the following commands to get the REST API hosted on
<http://127.0.0.1:80>

```console
$ docker run -p 80:80 -t sample-flask-rest-app
```

If it is loaded and if it runs successfully you will see a response
similar to

```console
Checking for script in /app/prestart.sh
Running script /app/prestart.sh
Running inside /app/prestart.sh, you could add migrations to this file, e.g.:

#! /usr/bin/env console

# Let the DB start
sleep 10;
# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

## Interact with the container

Now you can go in your web browser to the URL

 <http://127.0.0.1:80>

To see the status of the container you can sue the command

```console
$ docker ps -a
```

Note the CONTAINER ID. To sopt the container with a particular ID, use

```
$ docker stop dc8cccf22216
```

To delete the docker container image, you must first sop all instances
using it and the remove the image. YOu can see the images with the
command


```console
$ docker images
```

Then you can locate all containers using that image while looking in
the IMAGE column or using a simple fgrep in case you have many
images. stop the containers using that image and that you can say


```console
$ docker rm 74b9b994c9bd
```

while the number is the container id

Once you killed all containers using that image, you can remove the
image with the `rmi` command.

```console
$ docker rmi 8b3246425402
```
