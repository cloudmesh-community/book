Turtle Graphics
===============

Python comes with a nice demonstration program that allows you to learn
some simple programming concepts while moving a turtle on the screen. It
can be started with

    python -m turtledemo

Program example
---------------

You can also create programs with your favorite editor and run it. Let
us put the following code into the program `turtle_demo.py`. Never save
a file with the name `turtle.py` because python will import it instead
of the built-in turtle import that you need.

    import turtle

    window = turtle.Screen()
    robot = turtle.Turtle()

    robot.forward(50)   # Moves forward 50 pixels
    robot.right(90)     # Rotate clockwise by 90 degrees

    robot.forward(50)
    robot.right(90)

    robot.forward(50)
    robot.right(90)

    robot.forward(50)
    robot.right(90)

    turtle.done()

    window.mainloop()

After saving it you can run it from a terminal with

    $ python turtle_demo.py

Shape
-----

    shapes: "arrow", "turtle", "circle", "square", "triangle", "classic"

You can change the shape of your turtle to any of these shapes with the
Turtle method `shape(name)`. For example, if you have an instance of the
Turtle class called `robot`, you can make it appear as a turtle by
calling `robot.shape("turtle")`.

You can add your own shapes with the following functions:

    turtle.register_shape(name, shape=None)

    turtle.addshape(name, shape=None)

There are three different ways to call this function:

name is the name of a gif-file and shape is None: Install the
corresponding image shape.

    window.register_shape("turtle.gif")

Note: Image shapes do not rotate when turning the turtle, so they do not
display the heading of the turtle!

name is an arbitrary string and shape is a tuple of pairs of
coordinates: Install the corresponding polygon shape.

    window.register_shape("triangle", ((5,-3), (0,5), (-5,-3)))

name is an arbitrary string and shape is a (compound) Shape object:
Install the corresponding compound shape.

Add a turtle shape to TurtleScreen's shapelist. Only the registered
shapes can be used by issuing the command shape(shapename).
