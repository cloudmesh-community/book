## Contributing

The document is written in markdown and managed with a Makefile
developed by Gregor von Laszewski. Contributing  content is easy as
everything is stored in github in the following directory:

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/>

Content can be contributed via pull requests that are either created
while you directly edit the content via the github Web interface, or a
cloned version of the document. 

For simplicity we focus on contribution via the Web interface.
Naturally you need to have a github.com account and login. After you
have found a text that you like to improve, please edit it via the
Web interface and than generate a pull request. We will than review the
request and approve or comment on it. To make it even easier the ebook
contains cloud symbols (:cloud:) that indicate the start of a document
that you can modify. You can simply click on it and you will be automatically
redirected the the file for editing. As you can see it is rather
simple.

In case you clone and use command line or other GUI tools, please
create a pull request for each fix. Remember multiple students work in
parallel and fixes could conflict with each other. to minimize this
we recommend to to a pull request immediately after you corrected an
issue.
