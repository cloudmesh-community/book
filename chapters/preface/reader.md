# ePub Readers

This document is distributed in ePub format. Every OS has a suitable
ePub reader to view the document.  Such readers can also be integrated
into a Web browser so that when you click on an ePub it is automatically
opened in your browser. As we use ePubs the document can be scaled based
on the user's preference If you ever see a content that does not fit on a
page we recommend you zoom out to make sure you can see the entire
content.

We have made good experiences with the following readers:


* **macOSX**: [Books](https://www.apple.com/apple-books), which is a build
  in ebook reader
* **Windows 10**:
  [Microsoft edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge),
  but it must be the newest version, as older versions have bugs.
  Alternatively, use [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)
* **Linux**: [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)

If you have an iPad or Tablet with enough memory, you may also be able
to use them.

Sometimes you may want to adjust the zoom of your reader to increase or
decrease it. Please adjust your zoom to a level that is comfortable for
you. On macOS with a larger monitor, we found that zooming out multiple
times results in very good rendering allowing you to see the source code
without horizontal scrolling.
