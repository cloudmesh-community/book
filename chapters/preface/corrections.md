# Corrections

The material collected in this document is managed in

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/chapters>

In case you see an error or like to make a contribution of your own
section or chapter, you can do so in github via pull requests.

The easiest way to fix an error is to read the ePub and click on the
cloud ![Github](images/github.png) symbol in a heading where you see the error. This will
bring you to an editable document in github. You can directly fix
the error in the web browser and create there a pull request.
Naturally, you need to be signed into github before you can edit and
create a pull request.

As a result contributors and authors will be integrated automatically
next time we compile the material. Thus even if you corrected a single
spelling error, you will be acknowledged.
