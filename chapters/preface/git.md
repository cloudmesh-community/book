# Class Git

This class uses git to manage all assignment submissions. We use the
publicly available github.com. The class git is hosted at

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community>

It is in the responsibility of the student to create a GitHub account
and make sure that you will be added to the class GitHub within one week
of joining the class.  Make sure
to fill out the survey to communicate the github.com username.
