Figures have a caption and can be refereed to in the epub simple with a number. We show such a refernce 
pointer while refering to +@fig:code-example. 

![Figure example](images/code.png){#fig:code-example width=1in}

Figures must be written in the md as 

```
![Figure example](images/code.png){#fig:code-example width=1in}
```

You can refer to them with `+@fig:code-example`. Please note in order for numbering to work 
figure refernces must include the `#fig:`
