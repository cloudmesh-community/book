## epub Readers

This document is distributed in epub format. Every OS will have a
suitable epub reader to view the document.  Such readers can even be
integrated into the browser you use, and when you click on an epub
publication in github it could pop up the document in your reader. The
way we create the document is through scalable markup, that iss you
can zoom in and out of a page while the content will beautomatically
rendered for the selected page size. If you ever see a content that
does not fit on a page we recommend you zoom out with your reader to
make sure you can see the entire content.
