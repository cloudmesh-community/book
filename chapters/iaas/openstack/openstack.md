# OpenStack {#sec:openstack}

## Introduction

OpenStack can be described as a cloud operating system. OpenStack can
be used on private or public clouds to manage large amounts of compute,
storage and network resources. OpenStack is built up using a large
number or small software components, which will be described in more
detail in the next couple of sections. Another important aspect of
OpenStack is that it is completely OpenSource, which means that
anyone can access and use the product without having to pay any licensing
or any other fee. And since the source code is publicly available
under the Apache-2.0 License developers can modify and use OpenStack as
needed.

OpenStack is managed and maintained by the "The OpenStack Foundation",
which is an non-profit organization which organizers the development of
OpenStack and keeps the OpenStack community running.

## OpenStack Architecture

OpenStack consists of a large number of small components. Which
components to use for your OpenStack deployment depends on your usecases
and requirements. The existing components can be integrated to
achieve the desired deployment by carefully examining and understanding
each component. @fig:opsnstack-overview shows an high-level architecture
diagram of OpenStack which gives a clear understanding of how the
overall framework is organized.

However each of the high-level components are in constructed using
several small components. @fig:openstack-arch shows one such popular
deployment and its architecture.

## Components

The components in OpenStack can be divided into several sub-groups. And
each group has several components which specialize in various tasks. The
following list shows all the major component groups and components that
are listed under each group. The list is referenced from the OpenStack
documentation - [OpenStack Service List](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/openstack-components#openstack-services)

This list just includes the open stack services. Additionally, there are several other major component groups such as Operational Services,
 Add-Ons to Services and Bridges for Adjacent Tech listed in the
 services page at - [OpenStack Services](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/openstack-components#openstack-services).

## Core Services

Among all the service components that are available for OpenStack,
 there are 9 services that are considered to be *Core* services, these
 services are essential to any OpenStack deployment.

###  Nova - Compute

Nova is provides services to manage virtual machines in cloud
environments. It is also capble of handing other compute resources such
as containers and is highly scalable.

### Glance - Image Services

Glance adds image services capabilities to OpenStack, this allows open
stack users to manage virtual machine images and provides services such
as image registration and discovery.

### Swift - Object Storage

Swift allows developers refer to files and other data similar to object
references. All actual storage and management is handled by Swift
so the developers do not need to worry about were to store data and files

### Cinder - Block Storage

Cinder provides block storage management capabilities to OpenStack,
Cinder supports several block storage devices underneath and provides an
unified API so that developers do not need to worry or think about what
device is been used underneath.

### Neutron - Networking

Neutron provides networking capabilities to OpenStack. It allows the
creation and management of various networks that are used as the
communication medium for OpenStack deployments. Neutron supports
multi-tenancy and scale to large deployments with ease. Extension
frameworks for Neutron allow users to deploy more advance network
features such as VPN's, firewalls, load-balancer, etc.

### Horizon - Dashboard

Horizon is the graphical user interface(GUI) for OpenStack, which
developers can use to manage and monitor their OpenStack deployment.


### Keystone - Identity Service

Keystone is the identity management services in OpenStack, it keeps a
list of users and maps all the access rights for each user for all the
cloud services that are available in the OpenStack deployment. Keystone
supports several authentication mechanisms such as classical user name
password based authentication and token based systems

### Ceilometer - Telemetry

Ceilometer provides developers with billing and usage services that
allow developers to bill end users based on each individuals usage
amounts. It also records and saves usage values of the cloud for each
user so that anything that needs verification can be done.

### Heat - Orchestration

Heat is the orchestration component of OpenStack. It allows developers
to use a requirement files that define the resources requirements for
cloud application, which can later be referenced when needed.


## Access from Python and Scripts

### Libcloud

Libcloud provides for some selected functionalitya a reasonable interface to OpenStack. More information is provided in Section
[Python libcloud](#python-libcloud). More advanced resources are exposed through REST interfaces that may not be available in Libcloud. To access them new client libraroes that are not included in libcloud need to be developed. Such functionality was exposed for example in FutureGrid to access cloud metric data.


### DevStack

It is very convenient to be able to set up an OpenSTack depoyment for development purposes on our own single computer.

DevStack is a set of scripts that can be used by developers to manage
 and maintain their OpenStack development. DevStack was developed to
 increase the ease of use for developers. It is very useful to
 setup a developer environment where you can test your deployment. More
 detailed information regarding DevStack can be found in their official
 documentaion - [DevStack documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/)
