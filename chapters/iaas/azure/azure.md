will need to go to

* [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

You will see an image such as: @fig:registration.

![Registration](images/reg.png){#fig:registration}

On that image you click the `Start free` button to obtain a free one
year account. You will have to either create a new Microsoft account
or use the one from Indiana University which will be your IU id
followed by the @iu.edu domain. You will be redirected to the single
sign on from IU to proceed. If you use another e-mail you can
certainly do that and you free account sis not associated with the IU
account. This could be your Skype account or some other e-mail.  After
registration you will be provided with 12 months of free usage of a
few selected services and $200 credits for 30 days. At the end of 30 days, 
Azure disables your subscription. Your subscription is disabled to protect 
you from accidentally incurring charges for usage beyond the credit and free 
services included with your subscription. To continue using Azure services, 
you must upgrade your subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription. 
After you upgrade, your subscription still has access to free services for 12 months. 
You only get charged for usage beyond the free services and quantities.
The Azure Student Account requires that you to activate the account after 30 days of use.

## Introduction to the Azure Portal

Azure can be accessed via a portal. An introductory video from
Microsoft provides you with some elementary information:

[:clapper: Introduction to Azure Portal](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Azure/Get-Started-with-Azure-Portal/player)

## Creating a VM

Choose `Create a resource` in the upper left-hand corner of the Azure
portal. Select a VM name, and the disk type as SSD, then provide a
username. The password must be at least 12 characters long and meet
the defined complexity requirements. As the following: @fig:creating-a-vm.

![Creating a VM](images/create-windows-vm-portal-basic-blade.png){#fig:creating-a-vm}

## Create a Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS Virtual Machine in Azure

Here are the steps to create a Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS Virtual Machine in Azure. 

To start, go to the Azure Portal <https://portal.azure.com>.

Next, the locate the `Virtual Machines` option and select it:

![@label](images/virtualmachines.png)

Then to create a new virtual machine, select `Add`:

![@label](images/addvirtualmachines.png)

This will present you the configuration options needed to create a new virtual machine:

![@label](images/createavirtualmachine.png)

To configure the virtual machine, choose the following options or modify to your situational needs.

#### Subscription: 
`Azure for Students` (default)

#### Resource Group: 
`YourResourceGroupHere` (Create a new one if you do not have an available option.)

#### Virtual Machine Name: 
`EfiveothreeTest`

#### Region: 
`Central US` (default)

#### Availability Options: 
`No infrastructure redundancy required` (default)

#### Image: 
`Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS`

#### Size: 
`Standard D2s v3, 2 vcpus, 8GB memory`

#### Authentication type: 
`password` (Choose a username and a password that meet the requirements).


The next configuration section is `Disks`:

![@label](images/disks.png)

Choose the default configurations settings or modify to your liking the `OS disk type`. 
This example uses the `Standard SSD` option.

For `Networking` you can choose all the default configuration settings or modify to your liking:

![@label](images/networking.png)

For `Management` you can choose all the default configuration settings or modify to your liking:

![@label](images/management.png)

Last, create the virtual machine:

![@label](images/createvmvalidation.png)

Once the new VM has been created, Naviagate back to the `Virtual machines` and now discover your Virtual Machine:

![@label](images/newvmaftercreation.png)

After creation the virtual machine will be in a `running` status. 
You will want to decide if you want your virtual machine in a `running` status, 
else stop the VM so that you do not waste resources. 

## Remote access the Virtual Machine 
To remote access a virtual machine, you can use a client application like Putty: 
<https://www.putty.org/>.

To use Putty and access the virtual machine, you can configure DNS name in Azure 
instead of using an IP. This is performed in the Virtual Machine configuration under 
`DNS name`:

![@label](images/dns.png)

Click `Configure`.
You can chose a `static` IP setting or a `dynamic` IP (This example uses a static IP setting):

![@label](images/static.png)

To apply the setting,  click `save`.

Note: If you have not configured the `port` that connection will use, 
then connection will not be successful.

In your Virtual machine settings click `Connect` and review the connection settings.
This example shows the designated `port 22` to be the port that will remote connect to the virtual machine:

![@label](images/conncetandport.png)

To learn more about working with ports you can review the following: 
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/nsg-quickstart-portal>

Next, to connect to the virtual machine, lauch the Putty client and enter 
the DNS name of the virtual machine to connect to the virtual machine:

![@label](images/putty.png)

The first time the environment is accessed Putty, 
Putty will prompt to cache your servers host key. 
Select `Yes` when prompted:

![@label](images/cacheputtykey.png)

After the key is cached, it will be remember the next time you access the VM with the Putty client.
After the VM is successfully accessed in Puty, you will be prompted to enter your server credentials 
as specified in the virtual machine setup.

Once credentials are provided, you will be logged into your virtual machine:

![@label](images/loggedinviaputty.png)

To learn more about connecting to Azure virtual machines you can visit: 
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon>

## Starting a VM

Now we like to introduce you how to start a VM. Please note that VMS
do cost and reduce your free hours on Azure. Hence you need to make
sure you carefully review the charging rates and chose VM sizes and
types that minimize your charges.

A VM can be started through the Portal as follows: @fig:start-button.

* On the overview tqb, a VM can be started by clicking the `Start`
  button.

![Start button](images/start-button.png){#fig:start-button}


## Stopping the VM

It is the most important to stop your VMS once they are not in used,
or you get continuously charged. The portal allows you to see the list
of VM that you run as follows

To shut a VM down, please do the following: see @fig:stop-button.

* On the overview tab, a VM can be started by clicking the `Stop` button.

![Stop button](images/stop-button.png){#fig:stop-button}
