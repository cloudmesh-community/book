### Understanding the free tier

IBM watson provides a set of services for free with their Lite account. Since you did not provide any credit/debit card information when creating the account, by default you will
have a Lite account. The lite plan does apply usage caps for services offered under the plan. If you need to expand and remove such limits you would have to upgrade to a payed account
However the free quotas are typically more than sufficient for testing and learning purposes. For example under the Lite plan you can use the "Watson Assistant" service with caps such as 10K API
calls per month.
