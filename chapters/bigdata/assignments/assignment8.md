# Assignment 8 

For term paper submission, please send us the pdf file to your paper in
the submission. 

If you're doing a project, please make sure that the code is committed 
to the repository created at the beginning of the class. You can commit
all before submission. But make sure you submit the report, (pdf) and
the code for the project. Please follow the report guidelines provided
under Assignment 7.

Please note, there are no extensions for final project submission. If 
there is any issue, please discuss this with Professor or TA ahead of
time.

 

Special Note on Team Projects
 
Each member must submit the report. The common section must be Abstract,
Introduction, Overall process, results, etc. Each contributor must write
a section on his or her contribution to the project. This content must
be the additional 50% of the report. For instance, if the paper size is
8 pages for an individual project, another 4 pages explaining each
member's contribution must be added (for the two-person project). If
there are 4 members the additional pages must be 8 pages. 2 additional
pages per author. If results and methods involve your contribution,
clearly state it as a subsection, Author's Contribution. Good luck !!!
