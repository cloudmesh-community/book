# Assignment 6

In the sixth assignment, you will be working on (see @sec:534-week7)
lecture videos. Objectives are as follows.

1. Summarize what you have understood. (1 page)
2. Select a subtopic that you are interested in and research on the
   current trends (0.5 page)
3. Suggest ideas that could improve the existing work (imaginations and
   possibilities) (0.5 page)
4. Summarize a specific video segment in the video lectures. To do this
   you need to follow these guidelines. Mention the video lecture name
   and section identification number. And also specify which range of
   minutes you have focused on the specific video lecture (2 pages).
5. Pick a sport you like and show case how it can be used with Big Data
   in order to improve the game (1 page). Use techniques used in the
   lecture videos and mention which lecture video refers to this
   technique.

For this assignment we expect a 5-page document. You can use a single
column format for this document. Make sure you write exactly 5pages. For
your research section make sure you add citations to the sections that
you are going to refer. If you have issues in how to do citations you
can reach a TA to learn how to do that. We will try to include some
chapters on how to do this in our handbook. Submissions are in pdf
format only.
