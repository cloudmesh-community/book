# Assignment 3

In the second assignment, you will be working on [Week 3](../week3.md) lecture videos.
Objectives are as follows. 

1. Summarize what you have understood. (2 page)
2. Select a subtopic that you are interested in and research on the current trends (1 page)
3. Suggest ideas that could improve the existing work (imaginations and possibilities) (1 page)

For this assignment we expect a 4 page document. You can use a single column format for this 
document. Make sure you write exactly 4 pages. For your research section make sure you add
citations to the sections that you are going to refer. If you have issues in how to do citations
you can reach a TA to learn how to do that. We will try to include some chapters on how to do this
in our handbook. Submissions are in pdf format only.
