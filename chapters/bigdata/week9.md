# Introduction to Deep Learning Part II: Applications

This section covers the growing importance of the use of Deep Learning in Big Data Applications and Analytics. The Intro Unit is an introduction to the technology with examples incidental. The MNIST Unit covers an example on Google Colaboratory. The Technology Unit covers deep learning approaches in more detail than the Intro Unit. The Tech Unit covers the deep learning technology in more detail. The Application Unit cover deep learning applications at different levels of sophistication.

Applications of Deep Learning Unit Summary
This unit is an introduction to deep learning with currently 7 lessons

## Recommender: Overview of Recommender Systems

Recommender engines used to be dominated by collaborative filtering using matrix factorization and k'th nearest neighbor approaches. Large systems like YouTube and Netflix now use deep learning. We look at sysyems like Spotify that use multiple sources of information.

## MainlyMedicine: Overview of AI in Health and Telecommunication

Telecommunication Industry has little traditional growth to look forward to. It can use AI in its operation and exploit trove of Big Data it possesses. Medicine has many breakthrough opportunities but progress hard -- partly due to data privacy restrictions. Traditional Bioinformatics areas progress but slowly; pathology is based on imagery and making much better progress with deep learning
