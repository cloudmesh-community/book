# Cloud Computing :o2:

![No](images/no.png)

We describe the central role of Parallel computing in Clouds and Big
Data which is decomposed into lots of *Little data* running in
individual cores. Many examples are given and it is stressed that issues
in parallel computing are seen in day to day life for communication,
synchronization, load balancing and decomposition. Cyberinfrastructure
for e-moreorlessanything or moreorlessanything-Informatics and the
basics of cloud computing are introduced. This includes virtualization
and the important *as a Service* components and we go through several
different definitions of cloud computing.

Gartner's Technology Landscape includes hype cycle and priority matrix
and covers clouds and Big Data. Two simple examples of the value of
clouds for enterprise applications are given with a review of different
views as to nature of Cloud Computing. This IaaS (Infrastructure as a
Service) discussion is followed by PaaS and SaaS (Platform and Software
as a Service). Features in Grid and cloud computing and data are
treated. We summarize the 21 layers and almost 300 software packages in
the HPC-ABDS Software Stack explaining how they are used.

Cloud (Data Center) Architectures with physical setup, Green Computing
issues and software models are discussed followed by the Cloud Industry
stakeholders with a 2014 Gartner analysis of Cloud computing providers.
This is followed by applications on the cloud including data intensive
problems, comparison with high performance computing, science clouds and
the Internet of Things. Remarks on Security, Fault Tolerance and
Synchronicity issues in cloud follow. We describe the way users and data
interact with a cloud system. The Big Data Processing from an
application perspective with commercial examples including eBay
concludes section after a discussion of data system architectures.

## Parallel Computing (Outdated)

We describe the central role of Parallel computing in Clouds and Big
Data which is decomposed into lots of ''Little data'' running in
individual cores. Many examples are given and it is stressed that issues
in parallel computing are seen in day to day life for communication,
synchronization, load balancing and decomposition.

### Decomposition

We describe why parallel computing is essential with Big Data and
distinguishes parallelism over users to that over the data in problem.
The general ideas behind data decomposition are given followed by a few
often whimsical examples dreamed up 30 years ago in the early heady days
of parallel computing. These include scientific simulations, defense
outside missile attack and computer chess. The basic problem of parallel
computing -- efficient coordination of separate tasks processing
different data parts -- is described with MPI and MapReduce as two
approaches. The challenges of data decomposition in irregular problems
is noted.

### Parallel Computing in Society

This lesson from the past notes that one can view society as an approach
to parallel linkage of people. The largest example given is that of the
construction of a long wall such as that (Hadrian's wall) between
England and Scotland. Different approaches to parallelism are given with
formulae for the speed up and efficiency. The concepts of grain size
(size of problem tackled by an individual processor) and coordination
overhead are exemplified. This example also illustrates Amdahl's law and
the relation between data and processor topology. The lesson concludes
with other examples from nature including collections of neurons (the
brain) and ants.

### Parallel Processing for Hadrian's Wall

This lesson returns to Hadrian's wall and uses it to illustrate advanced
issues in parallel computing. First We describe the basic SPMD -- Single
Program Multiple Data -- model. Then irregular but homogeneous and
heterogeneous problems are discussed. Static and dynamic load balancing
is needed. Inner parallelism (as in vector instruction or the multiple
fingers of masons) and outer parallelism (typical data parallelism) are
demonstrated. Parallel I/O for Hadrian's wall is followed by a slide
summarizing this quaint comparison between Big data parallelism and the
construction of a large wall.

## Introduction

We discuss Cyberinfrastructure for e-moreorlessanything or
moreorlessanything-Informatics and the basics of cloud computing. This
includes virtualization and the important 'as a Service' components and
we go through several different definitions of cloud computing.Gartner's
Technology Landscape includes hype cycle and priority matrix and covers
clouds and Big Data. The unit concludes with two simple examples of the
value of clouds for enterprise applications. Gartner also has specific
predictions for cloud computing growth areas.

### Cyberinfrastructure for E-Applications

This introduction describes Cyberinfrastructure or e-infrastructure and
its role in solving the electronic implementation of any problem where
e-moreorlessanything is another term for moreorlessanything-Informatics
and generalizes early discussion of e-Science and e-Business.

### What is Cloud Computing: Introduction

Cloud Computing is introduced with an operational definition involving
virtualization and efficient large data centers that can rent computers
in an elastic fashion. The role of services is essential -- it underlies
capabilities being offered in the cloud. The four basic aaS's --
Software (SaaS), Platform (Paas), Infrastructure (IaaS) and Network
(NaaS) -- are introduced with Research aaS and other capabilities (for
example Sensors aaS are discussed later) being built on top of these.

### Gartner's Emerging Technology Landscape for Clouds and Big Data

This lesson gives Gartner's projections around futures of cloud and Big
data. We start with a review of hype charts and then go into detailed
Gartner analyses of the Cloud and Big data areas. Big data itself is at
the top of the hype and by definition predictions of doom are emerging.
Before too much excitement sets in, note that spinach is above clouds
and Big data in Google trends.

### Simple Examples of use of Cloud Computing

This short lesson gives two examples of rather straightforward
commercial applications of cloud computing. One is server consolidation
for multiple Microsoft database applications and the second is the
benefits of scale comparing gmail to multiple smaller installations. It
ends with some fiscal comments.

## Software and Systems

We cover different views as to nature of architecture and application
for Cloud Computing. Then we discuss cloud software for the cloud
starting at virtual machine management (IaaS) and the broad Platform
(middleware) capabilities with examples from Amazon and academic
studies. We summarize the 21 layers and almost 300 software packages in
the HPC-ABDS Software Stack explaining how they are used.

We start with a discussion of Cloud (Data Center) Architectures with
physical setup, Green Computing issues and software models. We summarize
a 2014 Gartner analysis of Cloud computing providers. This is followed
by applications on the cloud including data intensive problems,
comparison with high performance computing, science clouds and the

### Cloud (Data Center) Architectures

Some remarks on what it takes to build (in software) a cloud ecosystem,
and why clouds are the data center of the future are followed by
pictures and discussions of several data centers from Microsoft (mainly)
and Google. The role of containers is stressed as part of modular data
centers that trade scalability for fault tolerance. Sizes of cloud
centers and supercomputers are discussed as is "green" computing.

### Cloud Applications I

This short lesson discusses the need for security and issues in its
implementation. Clouds trade scalability for greater possibility of
faults but here clouds offer good support for recovery from faults. We
discuss both storage and program fault tolerance noting that parallel
computing is especially sensitive to faults as a fault in one task will
impact all other tasks in the parallel job.
