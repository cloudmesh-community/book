# Statistics {#s-statistics}

We assume that you are familiar with elementary statistics including

* mean, minimum, maximum
* standard deviation
* probability
* distribution
* frequency distribution
* Gaussian distribution
* bell curve
* standard normal probabilities
* tables (z table)
* Regression
* Correlation

Some of these terms are explained in various sections throughout our
application discussion. This includes especially the Physics section.
However these terms are so elementary that any undergraduate or highschool
book will provide you with a good introduction.

It is expected from you to identify these terms and you can contribute
to this section with non plagiarized subsections explaining these topics
for credit.

![No](images/no.png) Topics identified by a :?: can be contributed by students. If you are interested,
use piazza for announcing your willingness to do so. 

Mean, minimum, maximum:

## Exercise

E.Statistics.1:

> Pick a term from the previous list and define it while not plagiarizing. Create a pull request.
> Coordinate on piazza as to not duplicate someone else's contribution. Also
> look into outstanding pull requests.

E.Statistics.2:

> Pick a term from the previous list and develop a python program demonstrating it and create a pull
> request for a contribution into the examples directory. Make links to the github location.
> Coordinate on piazza as to not duplicate someone else's contribution. Also
> look into outstanding pull requests.
