# Overview of Data Science

*What is Big Data, Data Analytics and X-Informatics?*

We start with X-Informatics and its rallying cry. The growing number of
jobs in data science is highlighted. The first unit offers a look at the
phenomenon described as the Data Deluge starting with its broad
features. Data science and the famous DIKW (Data to Information to
Knowledge to Wisdom) pipeline are covered. Then more detail is given on
the flood of data from Internet and Industry applications with eBay and
General Electric discussed in most detail.

In the next unit, we continue the discussion of the data deluge with a
focus on scientific research. He takes a first peek at data from the
Large Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics and gives
some biology examples. He discusses the implication of data for the
scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive methodology
joining observation, theory and simulation as basic methods. Two broad
classes of data are the long tail of sciences: many users with
individually modest data adding up to a lot; and a myriad of Internet
connected devices -- the Internet of Things.

We give an initial technical overview of cloud computing as pioneered by
companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft with new centers holding up
to a million servers. The benefits of Clouds in terms of power
consumption and the environment are also touched upon, followed by a
list of the most critical features of Cloud computing with a comparison
to supercomputing. Features of the data deluge are discussed with a
salutary example where more data did better than more thought. Then
comes Data science and one part of it \~\~ data analytics \~\~ the large
algorithms that crunch the big data to give big wisdom. There are many
ways to describe data science and several are discussed to give a good
composite picture of this emerging field.

## Data Science generics and Commercial Data Deluge

We start with X-Informatics and its rallying cry. The growing number of
jobs in data science is highlighted. This unit offers a look at the
phenomenon described as the Data Deluge starting with its broad
features. Then he discusses data science and the famous DIKW (Data to
Information to Knowledge to Wisdom) pipeline. Then more detail is given

### What is X-Informatics and its Motto

This discusses trends that are driven by and accompany Big data. We give
some key terms including data, information, knowledge, wisdom, data
analytics and data science. We discuss how clouds running Data Analytics
Collaboratively processing Big Data can solve problems in X-Informatics.
We list many values of X you can defined in various activities across
the world.

### Jobs

Big data is especially important as there are some many related jobs. We
illustrate this for both cloud computing and data science from reports
by Microsoft and the McKinsey institute respectively. We show a plot
from LinkedIn showing rapid increase in the number of data science and
analytics jobs as a function of time.

### Data Deluge: General Structure

We look at some broad features of the data deluge starting with the size
of data in various areas especially in science research. We give
examples from real world of the importance of big data and illustrate
how it is integrated into an enterprise IT architecture. We give some
views as to what characterizes Big data and why data science is a
science that is needed to interpret all the data.

### Data Science: Process

We stress the DIKW pipeline: Data becomes information that becomes
knowledge and then wisdom, policy and decisions. This pipeline is
illustrated with Google maps and we show how complex the ecosystem of
data, transformations (filters) and its derived forms is.

### Data Deluge: Internet

We give examples of Big data from the Internet with Tweets, uploaded
photos and an illustration of the vitality and size of many commodity
applications.

### Data Deluge: Business

We give examples including the Big data that enables wind farms, city
transportation, telephone operations, machines with health monitors, the
banking, manufacturing and retail industries both online and offline in
shopping malls. We give examples from ebay showing how analytics
allowing them to refine and improve the customer experiences.

## Data Deluge and Scientific Applications and Methodology

### Overview of Data Science

We continue the discussion of the data deluge with a focus on scientific
research. He takes a first peek at data from the Large Hadron Collider
considered later as physics Informatics and gives some biology examples.
He discusses the implication of data for the scientific method which is
changing with the data-intensive methodology joining observation, theory
and simulation as basic methods. We discuss the long tail of sciences;
many users with individually modest data adding up to a lot. The last
lesson emphasizes how everyday devices \~\~ the Internet of Things \~\~
are being used to create a wealth of data.

### Science and Research

We look into more big data examples with a focus on science and
research. We give astronomy, genomics, radiology, particle physics and
discovery of Higgs particle (Covered in more detail in later lessons),
European Bioinformatics Institute and contrast to Facebook and Walmart.

### Implications for Scientific Method

We discuss the emergencies of a new fourth methodology for scientific
research based on data driven inquiry. We contrast this with third \~\~
computation or simulation based discovery - methodology which emerged
itself some 25 years ago.

### Long Tail of Science

There is big science such as particle physics where a single experiment
has 3000 people collaborate!.Then there are individual investigators who
donot generate a lot of data each but together they add up to Big data.

-   [:clapper: Long Tail of Science (2:10)](http://youtu.be/dwzEKEGYhqE)

### Internet of Things

A final category of Big data comes from the Internet of Things where
lots of small devices \~\~ smart phones, web cams, video games collect
and disseminate data and are controlled and coordinated in the cloud.

## Clouds and Big Data Processing; Data Science Process and Analytics

### Overview of Data Science

We give an initial technical overview of cloud computing as pioneered by
companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft with new centers holding up
to a million servers. The benefits of Clouds in terms of power
consumption and the environment are also touched upon, followed by a
list of the most critical features of Cloud computing with a comparison
to supercomputing.

He discusses features of the data deluge with a salutary example where
more data did better than more thought. He introduces data science and
one part of it \~\~ data analytics \~\~ the large algorithms that crunch
the big data to give big wisdom. There are many ways to describe data
science and several are discussed to give a good composite picture of
this emerging field.

## Clouds

We describe cloud data centers with their staggering size with up to a
million servers in a single data center and centers built modularly from
shipping containers full of racks. The benefits of Clouds in terms of
power consumption and the environment are also touched upon, followed by
a list of the most critical features of Cloud computing and a comparison
to supercomputing.

### Features of Data Deluge I

Data, Information, intelligence algorithms, infrastructure, data
structure, semantics and knowledge are related. The semantic web and Big
data are compared. We give an example where "More data usually beats
better algorithms". We discuss examples of intelligent big data and list
8 different types of data deluge

### Data Science Process

We describe and critique one view of the work of a data scientists. Then
we discuss and contrast 7 views of the process needed to speed data
through the DIKW pipeline.

### Data Analytics

We stress the importance of data analytics givi ng examples from several
fields. We note that better analytics is as important as better
computing and storage capability. In the second video we look at High
Performance Computing in Science and Engineering: the Tree and the
Fruit.
