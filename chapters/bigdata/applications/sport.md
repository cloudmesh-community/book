# Sports

Sports sees significant growth in analytics with pervasive statistics
shifting to more sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as game
is built around segments dominated by individuals where detailed
(video/image) achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are
moving field into big data arena. There are interesting relationships
between the economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at
Wearables and consumer sports/recreation. The importance of spatial
visualization is discussed. We look at other Sports: Soccer, Olympics,
NFL Football, Basketball, Tennis and Horse Racing.

## Basic Sabermetrics

This unit discusses baseball starting with the movie Moneyball and the
2002-2003 Oakland Athletics. Unlike sports like basketball and soccer,
most baseball action is built around individuals often interacting in
pairs. This is much easier to quantify than many player phenomena in
other sports. We discuss Performance-Dollar relationship including new
stadiums and media/advertising. We look at classic baseball averages and
sophisticated measures like Wins Above Replacement.
