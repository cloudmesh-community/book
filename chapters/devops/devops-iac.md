## Introduction to IaC


IaC(Infrastructure as Code) is the ability of code to generate, maintain and destroy application infrastructure like server, storage and networking, without requiring manual changes.
State of the infrastructure is maintained in files.

Cloud architectures, and containers have forced usage of IaC, as the amount of elements to manage at each layer are just too many. It is impractical to keep track with the traditional method of raising tickets and having someone do it for you. Scaling demands, elasticity during odd hours, usage-based-billing all require provisioning, managing and destroying infrastructure much more dynamically.

From the book "Amazon Web Services in Action" by Wittig [@awsinactionbook], using a script or a declarative description has
the following advantages

> * Consistent usage
> * Dependencies are handled
> * Replicable
> * Customizable
> * Testable
> * Can figure out updated state
> * Minimizes human failure
> * Documentation for your infrastructure

Sometimes IaC tools are also called Orchestration tools, but that label is not as accurate, and often misleading.


## How IaC is related to DevOps


DevOps has the following key practices
* Automated Infrastructure
* Automated Configuration Management, including Security
* Shared version control between Dev and Ops
* Continuous Build - Integrate - Test - Deploy
* Continuous Monitoring and Observability

The first practice - Automated Infrastructure can be fulfilled by IaC tools. By having the code for IaC and Configuration Management in the same code repository as application code ensures adhering to the practice of shared version control.

Typically, the workflow of the DevOps team includes running Configuration Management tool scripts after running IaC tools, for configurations, security, connectivity, and initializations.


## How IaC tools differs from Configuration Management Tools, and how it is related


There are 4 broad categories of such tools  [@terraformuprunningbook], there are
> * Ad hoc scripts: Any shell, Python, Perl, Lua scripts that are written
> * Configuration management tools: Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack
> * Server templating tools: Docker, Packer, Vagrant
> * Server provisioning tools: Terraform, Heat, CloudFormation, Cloud Deployment Manager, Azure Resource Manager

Configuration Management tools make use of scripts to achieve a state. IaC tools maintain state and metadata created in the past.

However, the big difference is the state achieved by running procedural code or scripts may be different from state when it was created because
 * Ordering of the scripts determines the state. If the order changes, state will differ. Also, issues like waiting time required for resources to be created, modified or destroyed have to be correctly dealt with.
 * Version changes in procedural code are inevitable, and will lead to a different state.

Chef and Ansible are more procedural, while Terraform, CloudFormation, SaltStack, Puppet and Heat are more declarative.

IaC or declarative tools do suffer from inflexibility related to expressive scripting language.


## Listing of IaC Tools


IaC tools that are cloud specific are
Amazon AWS - AWS CloudFormation
Google Cloud - Cloud Deployment Manager
Microsoft Azure - Azure Resource Manager
OpenStack - Heat

Terraform is not a cloud specific tool, and is multi-vendor. It has got good support for all the clouds, however, Terraform scripts are not portable across clouds.


## Advantages of IaC


IaC solves the problem of *environment drift*, that used to lead to the infamous
"but it works on my machine" kind of errors that are difficult to
trace. According to [@WhatisIaC002]

> IaC guarantees Idempotence -- known/predictable end state --  irrespective of starting
> state. Idempotency is achieved by either automatically configuring an
> existing target or by discarding the existing target and recreating a
> fresh environment.



## Further Reading


Please see books and resources like the "Terraform Up and Running" [@terraformuprunningbook] for more real-world
advice on IaC, structuring Terraform code and good deployment practices.

A good resource for IaC is the book "Infrastructure as Code" [@iacbook].
