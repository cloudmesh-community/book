Microsoft provides unified tool called Azure Monitor for end-to-end monitoring of the infrastructure and deployed applications.

Azure Monitor accommodates applications developed in various programming languages - .NET, Java, Node.JS, Python and various others. 
With Azure Application Insights telematics API incorporated into the applications, Azure Monitor can provide more detailed metrics and 
analytics around specific tracking needs - usage, bugs, etc.

Azure Monitor can help us track the health, performance and scalability issues of the infrastructure - VMs, Containers, Storage, Network and 
all Azure Services by automatically providing various platform metrics, activity and diagnostic logs.

Azure Monitor provides programmatic access through Power Shell scripts to access the activity and diagnostic logs. 
It also allows querying them using powerful querying tools for advanced in-depth analysis and reporting.

Azure Monitor proactively monitors and notifies us of critical conditions - 
reaching quota limits, abnormal usage, health-checks and recommendations along with making attempts to correct some of those aspects.

Azure Monitor Dashboards allow visualize various aspects of the data - metrics, logs, usage patterns in tabular and graphical widgets.

Azure Monitor also facilitates closer monitoring of micro-services if they are provided through Azure Serverless Function-As-Service.
