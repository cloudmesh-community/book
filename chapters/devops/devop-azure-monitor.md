Microsoft provides unified tool called Azure Monitor for end-to-end
monitoring of the infrastructure and deployed applications. Azure
Monitor can greatly help Dev-Op teams by proactively and reactively
monitoring the applications for bug tracking, health-check and provide
metrics that can hint on various scalability aspects.

Azure Monitor accommodates applications developed in various
programming languages - .NET, Java, Node.JS, Python and various
others. With Azure Application Insights telematics API incorporated
into the applications, Azure Monitor can provide more detailed metrics
and analytics around specific tracking needs - usage, bugs, etc.

Azure Monitor can help us track the health, performance and
scalability issues of the infrastructure - VMs, Containers, Storage,
Network and all Azure Services by automatically providing various
platform metrics, activity and diagnostic logs.

Azure Monitor provides programmatic access through Power Shell scripts
to access the activity and diagnostic logs. It also allows querying
them using powerful querying tools for advanced in-depth analysis and
reporting.

Azure Monitor proactively monitors and notifies us of critical
conditions - reaching quota limits, abnormal usage, health-checks and
recommendations along with making attempts to correct some of those
aspects.

Azure Monitor Dashboards allow visualize various aspects of the data -
metrics, logs, usage patterns in tabular and graphical widgets.

Azure Monitor also facilitates closer monitoring of micro-services if
they are provided through Azure Serverless Function-As-Service.
