# Puppet :smiley:

:o: ubuntu 16.04 is outdated. Could that not be done on 18.04

:white_check_mark: Installed in 18.04. Created two VM. 
Installed Puppet Master on on VM and Puppet agent on other VM.
Used bridged network so that both VM can communicate with each other. 
Verified and tested successful installation.
Installed Puppet Enterprise on Ubuntu 18.04 using both web and text mode install methods and successfully tested.
Updated Puppet Enterprise report content based on result of successful installation. 
Removed redundant steps from content and organized steps for Puppet Enterprise installation.


:o: export PECONFPATH=path of pe.conf file, this would mean you need to put a $ before PECONFPATH when using it

:white_check_mark: Corrected

:o: review has been halted as it was verified that this was not tested
by the contributor. We can not accept sections and chapters that are
not tested. If unclear discuss in the online hours.

:white_check_mark: created new version of md file. This version contains
verified and tested command of installing open source puppet on Ubuntu

:o: create a real example possibly usingg virtual machines

:white_check_mark: This version contains verified and tested command of 
installing open source puppet on Ubuntu VM


:o: use a $ in front of a bash command

:white_check_mark: used $ before bash command wherever it was missing


:o: use of a and the needs to be checked as it seems there is	
a different opinion on how to use this. changes thet Gregor did were

## Overview

Configuration management is an important task of IT department in any
organization. It is process of managing infrastructure changes in
structured and systematic way. Manual rolling back of infrastructure
to previous version of software is cumbersome, time consuming and
error prone.  Puppet is configuration management tool that simplifies
complex task of deploying new software, applying software updates and
rollback software packages in large cluster efficiently. Puppet does
this through Infrastructure as Code (IAC). Code is written for
infrastructure on one central location and is pushed to nodes in all
environments (Dev, Test, Production) using puppet tool.  Configuration
management tool has two approaches for managing infrastructure;
Configuration push and pull. In push configuration, infrastructure as
code is pushed from centralized server to nodes whereas in pull
configuration nodes pulls infrastructure as code from central server
as shown in @fig:InfrastructureAsCode.

![Infrastructure As Code [@hid-sp18-523-puppetimages]](images/IAC.jpg){#fig:InfrastructureAsCode}


Puppet uses push and pull configuration in centralized manner 
as shown in @fig:push-pull-config.

![push-pull-config Image [@hid-sp18-523-puppetimages]](images/push-pull-configuration.jpg){#fig:push-pull-config}



Another popular infrastructure tool is Ansible. It does not have
master and client nodes. Any node in Ansible can act as executor. Any
node containing list of inventory and SSH credential can play master
node role to connect with other nodes as opposed to puppet
architecture where server and agent software needs to be setup and
installed.  Configuring Ansible nodes is simple, it just requires
python version 2.5 or greater.  Ansible uses push architecture for
configuration.

## Master slave architecture

Puppet uses master slave architecture as shown in @fig:master-slave. 
Puppet server is called as master node and client nodes are called as puppet 
agent. Agents poll server at regular interval and pulls updated  configuration 
from master. Puppet Master is highly available. It supports multi master 
architecture. If one master goes down backup  master stands up to serve 
infrastructure. 

#### Workflow

* nodes (puppet agents) sends information (for e.g IP, hardware detail,
  network etc.) to master. Master stores such information in manifest
  file.
* Master node compiles catalog file containing configuration
  information that needs to be implemented on agent nodes.
* Master pushes catalog to puppet agent nodes for implementing
  configuration.
* Client nodes send back updated report to Master. Master updates its
  inventory.
* All exchange between master and agent is secured through SSL
  encryption (see @fig:master-slave)

![Master and Slave Architecture [@hid-sp18-523-puppetimages]](images/master-slave.jpg){#fig:master-slave}

@fig:master-slave1, shows flow between master and slave.

Puppet comes in two forms. Open source Puppet and Enterprise
In this tutorial we will showcase installation steps of both
forms.


## Install Opensource Puppet on Ubuntu

We will demonstrate installation of Puppet on Ubuntu

Prerequisite - Atleast 4 GB RAM, Ubuntu box ( standalone or VM )

First, we need to make sure that Puppet master and agent is able
to communicate with each other. Agent should be able to connect
with master using name. 

configure Puppet server name and map with its ip address

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

contents of the `/etc/hosts` should look like

```
<ip_address> my-puppet-master
```

my-puppet-master is name of Puppet master to which Puppet agent would
try to connect

press `<ctrl> + O` to Save and `<ctrl> + X` to exit

Next, we will install Puppet on Ubuntu  server. 
We will execute the following commands to pull from official 
Puppet Labs Repository

```bash
$ curl -O https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-xenial.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-xenial.deb
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Intstall the Puppet server

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install puppetserver
```

Default instllation of Puppet server is configured to use 2 GB
of RAM. However, we can customize this by opening puppetserver
configuration file

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/default/puppetserver
```

This will open the file in editor. Look for JAVA_ARGS line and
change the value of `-Xms` and `-Xmx` parameters to 3g if we wish
to configure Puppet server for 3GB RAM. Note that default value
of this parameter is 2g.

```
JAVA_ARGS="-Xms3g -Xmx3g -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
```

press `<ctrl> + O` to Save and `<ctrl> + X` to exit
 
By default Puppet server is configured to use port 8140 to 
communicate with agents. We need to make sure that firewall
allows to communicate on this port 

```bash
$ sudo ufw allow 8140
```

next, we start Puppet server 

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start puppetserver
```

Verify server has started 

```
$ sudo systemctl status puppetserver
```

we would see "active(running)" if server has started successfully 

```
$ sudo systemctl status puppetserver
● puppetserver.service - puppetserver Service

lines 1-11/11 (END)
```

configure Puppet server to start at boot time

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable puppetserver
```


Next, we will install Puppet agent

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install puppet-agent
```

start Puppet agent

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start puppet
```

configure Puppet agent to start at boot time

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable puppet
```

next, we need to change Puppet agent config file so that 
it can connect to Puppet master and communicate

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
```

configuration file will be opened in an editor. Add following
sections in file

```
[main]
certname = <puppet-agent>
server = <my-puppet-server>

[agent]
server = <my-puppet-server>
```

*Note: my-puppet-server is the name that we have set up in 
 /etc/hosts file while installing Puppet server. And certname
 is the name of the certificate*
 
 Puppet agent sends certificate signing request to Puppet server 
 when it connects first time. After signing request, Puppet server
 trusts and identifies agent for managing.
 
 execute following command on Puppet Master in order to see all 
 incoming cerficate signing requests
 
 ```bash
 $ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list
 ```
 
 we will see something like
 
 ```
 $ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list
  "puppet-agent" (SHA256) 7B:C1:FA:73:7A:35:00:93:AF:9F:42:05:77:9B:
  05:09:2F:EA:15:A7:5C:C9:D7:2F:D7:4F:37:A8:6E:3C:FF:6B
```
 
* Note that puppet-agent is the name that we have configured for certname
in puppet.conf file*

After validating that request is from valid and trusted agent, we sign
the request 

```bash
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign puppet-agent
```

we will see message saying certificate was signed if successful

```
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign puppet-agent
Signing Certificate Request for:
  "puppet-agent" (SHA256) 7B:C1:FA:73:7A:35:00:93:AF:9F:42:05:77:9B:05:09:2F:
  EA:15:A7:5C:C9:D7:2F:D7:4F:37:A8:6E:3C:FF:6B
Notice: Signed certificate request for puppet-agent
Notice: Removing file Puppet::SSL::CertificateRequest puppet-agent 
at '/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/requests/puppet-agent.pem'
```
 
Next, we will verify installation and make sure that Puppet server
is able to push configuration to agent. Puppet uses domian specific language 
code written in manifests ( .pp ) file 

create default manifest site.pp file 

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
```

This will open file in edit mode. Make following changes to this file

```
file {'/tmp/it_works.txt':                        # resource type file and filename
  ensure  => present,                             # make sure it exists
  mode    => '0644',                              # file permissions
  content => "It works!\n",  # Print the eth0 IP fact
}
```

domain specific language is used to create it_works.txt file inside /tmp
directory on agent node. ensure directive make sure that file is present.
It creates one if file is removed. mode directive specifies that process 
has write permission on file to make changes. content directive is used to 
define content of the changes applied [hid-sp18-523-open]

next, we test the installation on single node

```bash
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test
```

successfull verification will display

## Installation of Puppet Enterprise


First, download `ubuntu-<version and arch>.tar.gz` and CPG 
signature file on Ubuntu VM  


Second, we import Puppet public key 

```bash
$ wget -O - https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/puppet-gpg-signing-key.pub | gpg --import
```

we will see ouput as

```

```

Third, we print fingerprint of used key

```bash
$ gpg --fingerprint 0x7F438280EF8D349F
```

we will see successful output as

```
pub   rsa4096 2016-08-18 [SC] [expires: 2021-08-17]

sub   rsa4096 2016-08-18 [E] [expires: 2021-08-17]
```

Fourth, we verify release signature of installed package

```bash
$ gpg --verify puppet-enterprise-VERSION-PLATFORM.tar.gz.asc
```

successful output will show as

```
gpg: assuming signed data in 'puppet-enterprise-2019.0.2-ubuntu-18.04-amd64.tar.gz'

Primary key fingerprint: 6F6B 1550 9CF8 E59E 6E46  9F32 7F43 8280 EF8D 349
```

Next, we need to unpack installation tarball.
Store location of path in `$TARBALL` variable. This  variable will be
used in our installation.

```bash
$ export TARBALL=path of tarball file
```

then, we extract tarball

```bash
$ tar -xf $TARBALL
```

Next, we run installer from installer directory

```bash
$ sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer
```

This will ask us to chose installation option; we could chose from
guided installation or text based installation

```
~/pe/puppet-enterprise-2019.0.2-ubuntu-18.04-amd64
$ sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer
~/pe/puppet-enterprise-2019.0.2-ubuntu-18.04-amd64 
~/pe/puppet-enterprise-2019.0.2-ubuntu-18.04-amd64
=============================================================
    Puppet Enterprise Installer
=============================================================

## Installer analytics are enabled by default.
## To disable, set the DISABLE_ANALYTICS environment variable and rerun 
this script. 
For example, "sudo DISABLE_ANALYTICS=1 ./puppet-enterprise-installer".
## If puppet_enterprise::send_analytics_data is set to false in your 
existing pe.conf, this is not necessary and analytics will be disabled.

Puppet Enterprise offers three different methods of installation.

[1] Express Installation (Recommended)

This method will install PE and provide you with a link at the end 
of the installation to reset your PE console admin password

Make sure to click on the link and reset your password before proceeding 
to use PE

[2] Text-mode Install

This method will open your EDITOR (vi) with a PE config file (pe.conf) 
for you to edit before you proceed with installation.

The pe.conf file is a HOCON formatted file that declares parameters 
and values needed to install and configure PE.
We recommend that you review it carefully before proceeding.

[3] Graphical-mode Install

This method will install and configure a temporary webserver to walk 
you through the various configuration options.

NOTE: This method requires you to be able to access port 3000 on this 
machine from your desktop web browser.

=============================================================

 How to proceed? [1]: 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Press 3 for web based Graphic-mode-Install

when successfull, we will see output as

```

## Go to https://<localhost>:3000 in your browser to continue installation.

```

By default Puppet Enterprise server uses 3000 port. Make sure that 
firewall allows communication on port 3000

```bash
$ sudo ufw allow 3000
```

Next, go to `https://localhost:3000` url for completing installation

Click on `get started` button.

Chose install on this server

Enter `<mypserver>` as DNS name. This is our Puppet Server name.
This can be configured in confile file also.

Enter console admin password

Click continue 

we will get confirm the plan screen with following information

```

Documentation: https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2019.0/pe_user_guide.html
Release notes: https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2019.0/pe_release_notes.html

If this is a monolithic configuration, run 'puppet agent -t' to complete the 
setup of this system.

If this is a split configuration, install or upgrade the remaining PE components, 
and then run puppet agent -t on the Puppet master, PuppetDB, and PE console, 
in that order.
~/pe/puppet-enterprise-2019.0.2-ubuntu-18.04-amd64
2019-02-02T22:08:14.805-05:00 Running command: /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet 
agent --enable
~/pe/puppet-enterprise-2019.0.2-ubuntu-18.04-amd64$
```

This is called as monolithic installation as all components of 
Puppet Enterprise such as Puppet master, PuppetDB and Console are 
installed on single node. This installation type is easy to install.
Troubleshooting errors and upgrading infrastructure using this type
is simple. This installation type can easily support infrastructure
of up to 20,000 managed nodes. Compiled master nodes can be added as
network grows. This is recommended installation type for small to 
mid size organizations [@hid-sp18-523-mono].


`pe.conf` configuration file will be opened in editor to configure
values. This file contains parameters and values for installing, 
upgrading and configuring Puppet.

Some important parameters that can be specified in 
`pe.conf` file are

```bash
console_admin_password
puppet_enterprise::console_host
puppet_enterprise::puppetdb_host
puppet_enterprise::puppetdb_database_name
puppet_enterprise::puppetdb_database_user
```

Lastly, we run puppet after installation is complete

```bash
$ puppet agent -t 
```


Text mode split installation is performed for large networks.
Compared to monolithic installation split installation type
can manage large infrastucture that requires more than 20,000
nodes.  In this type of installation different components of 
Puppet Enterprise (master, PuppetDB and Console) are installed
on different nodes. This installation type is recommended for
organizations with large infrastructure needs [@hid-sp18-523-split]. 

In this type of installation, we need to install componenets in 
specific order. First master then puppet db followed by console.


Puppet Enterprise master and agent settings can be configured in
`puppet.conf` file. Most configuration settings of Puppet Enterprise 
componenets such as Master, Agent and  security certificates are all 
specified in this file.

Config section of Agent Node


```bash
[main]

certname = <http://your-domain-name.com/>
server = puppetserver
environment = testing
runinterval = 4h
```

Config section of Master Node


```bash
[main]

certname =  <http://your-domain-name.com/>
server = puppetserver
environment = testing
runinterval = 4h
strict_variables = true
```


```bash
[master]

dns_alt_names = puppetserver,puppet, <http://your-domain-name.com/>
reports = pupated
storeconfigs_backend = puppetdb
storeconfigs = true
environment_timeout = unlimited
```

Comment lines, Settings lines and Settings variables are main
components of puppet configuration file. Comments in config files 
are specified by prefixing hash character. Setting line consists 
name of setting followed by equal sign, value of setting are specified 
in this section. Setting variable value generally consists of one word 
but multiple can be specified in rare cases [@hid-sp18-523-config].
