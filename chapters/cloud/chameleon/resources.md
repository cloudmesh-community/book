In any case please visit the Chameleon Web page as there is also more
information about other topics that we may not care about. Furthermore
we do not use Advanced Appliances, but use ansible instead as it is
independent from OpenStack and can be used with other frameworks.

If you prefer you can also go to the Chameleon Web site using the
following links. However we have improved some of the documentation
found in this document. We would like to get your feedback in case you
find errors or like to contribute tho this documentation.

Chameleon cloud promotes insecure use of ssh while suggesting passphrase
less keys. This is **very dangerous** due to the fact that someone could
gain access to your computer and if a password less key is stolen easy
access to other systems can be achieved. Instead you must use whenever
possible passphrases and use ssh agent and ssh add!

Hence do not use their advise that is mentioned multiple times in their
documentation. Follow ours!
