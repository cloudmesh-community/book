# Documentation and other Resources

You can also visit the Chameleon Web page as there is more information
about other topics that we may not need to worry about. This mostly
includes using chameleon cloud as a bare metal resource and appliances,
which we typically will not use.

If you prefer you can also go to the Chameleon Web site using the
following links. However we have improved some of the documentation
found in this document. The links to Chameleons online resources are:

- [Web page](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/)
- [Documentation ](https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [News](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/news/)
- [About](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/about/chameleon/)
- [Log in](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/login/)
- [Dashborad](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/dashboard/)

Howevever, we have augmented some information and even provided
corrections that are not covered on the Chameleon cloud Web Page. The
information that overlap between the Web page and this material have
bebeen copied and modified with permission from the Chameleoncloud team.

## Outages

Any computer system may undergo maintenance. Before filing tickets with
Chameleon cloud, make sure that the cloud is operational. Outages are
posted at

<https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/outages/>


## Account Creation

The fist step to get access Chameleon cloud is to create a user account
if you do not already have one. You can skip to the next section if you
have a chameleon cloud account.

The register web page is available at:

<https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/register/>

For more details, please als consult the chameleon chapter in the
handbook.

## Join a Project

An active project is required to access compute resources. Each class
has a particular project number that you will need to write down as you
will use it to interact with the system. The information is given out by
the instructor.

For the Fall 2019 516 related classes please use the following project number:

* [CH-819337](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/projects/37347/)

However, before you can access it, the instructor (in our class Dr. von
Laszewski) needs to authorize you to use the project. For this you have
filled out an account survey that you were pointed to in piazza. The most
common errors we see are that students provide us with the wrong user
name or have not applied for a chameleon account. Once the instructor
has added you, you will be able to use VM's on Chameleon cloud.

> **Note:** If you use chameleon cloud for another class, please
> consult with your instructor and obtain a project number from
> them. You will have to let them know your chameleon user ID, so they
> can activate your account.

## Usage Restriction

As using VM's in a shared environment has ain impact on resources for
all, you are **REQUIRED** to shut down your resources after you are not
using them anymore. Furthermore, before the class is over and we assign
grades you must terminate your instances and free all ip addresses.
Remember that any running VM is just like you were running a real
computer. I am sure you close the lid of your laptop when not in use.
Shutting down the VM is similar and avoids that you unnecessarily use
resources that others could use in a shared environment. Furthermore, if
you keep the machines running you will use energy and have an impact on
the environment. **Be a team player** and be environmentally conscious
by shutting  down your non used instances. The way we use chameleon
cloud is as a large team. As such please avoid deleting other peoples
VM's. All vms that do not follow a particular namig scheme ar subject to
deletion at any time.

The pattern of the vms must follow:

* any vm owned by gregor is allowed: `*gregor*` if it is owned by Gregor
* any vm with the name `NNN-firstname-i`, where NNN is the last digit of 
  your hid from class, firstname is your firstname and i is an integer.
