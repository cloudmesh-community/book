`virsh` is a command line interface tool for managing guests and the
hypervisor.

To initiate a hypervisor session with virsh :

    virsh connect <name>

Where is the machine name of the hypervisor. If you want to initiate a
read-only connection, append the previous command with -readonly.

defined but are not currently active). The --all domain lists all
domains, whether active or not.
