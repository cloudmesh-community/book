Virtualization is one of the important technologies that started the
cloud revolution. It provides the basic underlying principles for the
development and adoption of clouds. The concept, although old and
already used in the early days of computing, has recently been
exploited to lead to better utilization of servers as part of data
centers, but also the local desktops.

Virtualization enables to execute multiple applications in such a way
that the applications seem to run independently form each other in
their own virtualized context.

Examples of the usefulness of virtualization include testing of
applications and run experiments on a different operating system than
the one on our host computer. To enable this we need virtual machines.

## Virtual Machines

We define a virtual machine as follows:

> A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a computer
> system. This can include process virtualization and physical
> computer virtualization such as running an operating
> system. Multiple virtual machines share the resources of the
> computer or system on which they run.

We distinguish the following types of Virtual machines

* **System Virtual Machines** or **Hardware Virtual Machine**, which
  is the virtualization of the operating system providing a complete
  system platform environment emulating the hardware. Here we
  essentially run another operating system on top of the existing OS
  while using a software abstraction between them allowing the
  virtualization.

  Examples of such virtualization include VirtualBox and VMWare.

* **Process Virtual Machines** or **Application Virtual Machine**
  which provides a platform independent programming environment that
  abstracts the details of the underneath hardware or OS from software
  or application runtime.

  Examples of such virtual machines include Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
  and the .NET Framework

Next we will be analyzing the system machine virtualization in more
detail, as they are one of the reasons for the clouds revolution.

## System Virtual Machines

The use of a system as a virtual machine has its clear advantages for
the cloud. We distinguish two main ways of system virtualizing:

* **Bare-metal Virtualization** in which the virtual machine monitor
  is installed directly on top of the hardware so that the it has
  direct access to the underlying hardware. It hosts the operating
  system. The VMM is also called hypervisor. We also use for
  bare-metal supporting VMM the term *Type 1 hypervisor*.

* **Hosted Virtualization** in which the base operating system is
  installed on the hardware. Here a virtual machine monitor (VMM) is
  installed on top of the host OS allowing the users to run
  other operating systems on the VMM. In addition, the Virtual Machine
  Monitor or *Hypervisor* manages the deployments of potentially
  multiple virtual machines on top of the underlying Operating system.
  We also use for hosted VMM the term *Type 2 hypervisor*.

In either case the functionality a virtual machine is supported
through configuration files, specifications, and access to the
physical resources either directly or indirectly through the host
OS. A virtual machine provides the same functionality as a physical
computer, but with the advantage that through virtualization the are
portable, can be managed and provide increased security while
shielding the underlying OS from harmful actions. As a virtual
machine is in principle a program, it consists of several files
including a configuration file, virtual disk files, virtual RAM, and a
log file. Virtual machines are configured to run a virtual operating
system that allows applications to run on them. Each virtual machine
has its own copy of the OS making it independent and more secure.

End users and developers will benefit from using virtual machines in
case they need to operate or support on different hardware or porting
software on it.

## Hosted Virtualization

As in the hosted virtualization the guest operating system accessed
the underlying hardware through the host OS, it usually has limited
access to the hardware as defined by the host OS. This allows the host
OS to impose policies that govern the operation of multiple guest OS
concurrently. This includes management and scheduling of processes,
memory, I/O operations to assign them appropriately to the guest
OS. Through this mechanism the hypervisor provides an emulation of
available hardware to each Virtual Machine run on top of it in
time-sharing fashion for resource constrained or resource shared
activities.

As example, the hypervisor has the ability to present generic I/O
devices and it has no access to non-generic I/O devices. Generic I/O
devices are network, interface cards, CD-ROMs. Examples for
non-generic I/O devices are PCI data acquisition card, etc. However
with appropriate driver support even such devices could be made
accessible to the VMs.

Often we also find that hosted virtualization supports connected USB
drives in the VMs which becomes very practical for USB attached
devices needed in storage, or even edge computing applications.


Advantages of Hosted Virtualization include

* Multiple Operating systems run on separate virtual machines on a VMM.
* Different Operating systems run on separate virtual machines on a VMM.
* Hardware level driver support is controlled by VMM, allowing an
  isolation of certain security aspects for accessing the hardware.
* Installation of software can be done by the owner of the virtual
  machine and does not have to be conducted by the provider of the
  hypervisor.

Disadvantages of Hosted Virtualization include


* Increased resource requirements as the Guest OS is running a full
  copy of the OS. In its worst case this will lead to a significant
  performance reduction while using resources that are in contention.
* The user of hypervisors must be familiar with operating system
   management and security to ensure it is safe to use.

## Summary

To showcase how these technologies relate to each other you may
review @fig:vm-taxonomy


![Virtualization Taxonomy [@paravsfull-virt]](images/vm.png){#fig:vm-taxonomy}

We summarize the following *hypervisor* types:

* Type-1 hypervisors supporting native or bare-metal. They run
  directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and to
  manage guest operating systems.

* Type-2 hypervisors supporting hosted virtualization. They run on a
  conventional operating system (OS) just as other computer programs
  do. A guest operating system runs as a process on the host.

## Virtualization Approches

Next we look at different virtualization approaches that relate to
resource utilization.

### Full virtualization

When looking at virtualization we often identify it with being a full
virtualization. The hypervisor provides a full abstraction of the
hardware exposed to the guest OSs. In this case, the guest OSs the
virtual machine just run without any special modification on the host
OS. It just looks like an independent running computer
[@paravsfull-virt].

### Paravirtualization

Para -- alongside/partial -- virtualization is developed to improve
performance by interacting between the OS and the hypervisor. This is
done for complex and time-consuming tasks that otherwise could not be
managed by the VMM manager. Commands sent from the OS to the
hypervisor are called *hypercalls* [@paravsfull-virt].

## Virtualization Technologies

In this section we cover introduction to underlying virtualization
technologies used on some mainstream platforms.

Cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google, and OpenStack use for
example QEMU and KVM technologies for compute instance virtualization.

### Selected Hardware Virtualization Technologies

### AMD-V and Intel-VT

The hardware virtualization support enabled by AMD-V and Intel VT
technologies introduces virtualization in the x86 processor
architecture. According to Intel, Intel Hyper-Threading Technology
allows a single processor to execute two or more separate threads
concurrently. When it is enabled, multi-threaded software applications
can execute their threads in parallel, thereby improving their
performance.

### I/O MMU virtualization (AMD-Vi and Intel VT-d)

The term IOMMU is an abbreviation for input–output memory management
unit. An IOMMU allows through virtual addresses to interface with
physical addresses, allowing external direct-memory-access–capable IO
devices to interface with the main memory [@iommu-1]. AMD's I/O
Virtualization Technology (AMD-Vi) was originally called *IOMMU*.

To use Intel's *Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O* (VT-d),
both the motherboard chipset and system firmware (BIOS or UEFI) need
to fully support the IOMMU I/O virtualization functionality for it to
be usable [@iommu-2].



### Selected VM Virtualization Software and Tools

A number of noteworthy virtualization software and tools exist which
make the development and use of virtualization on the hardware
possible. They include

* Libvirt
* KVM
* Xen
* Hyper-V
* QEMU
* VMWare
* VirtualBox

We will be discussing them next.


#### Libvirt

[Libvirt](<https://libvirt.org/api.html>) is an library with an API
for managing virtualization solutions such as provided by KVM and
Xen. It provides a common management API for them, allowing uniform,
cross-hypervisor interfaces for higher-level management
tools. `Libvirt` provides a toolkit to manage virtualization hosts and
supports a wide set of languages, such as C, Python, Perl, and Java.
Drivers are the basic building block for libvirt functionality to
support the capability to handle specific hypervisor driver
calls. Drivers are discovered and registered during connection
processing as part of the `virInitializeAPI`.  Each driver has a
registration API which loads up the driver specific function
references for the libvirt APIs to call.  The following is a
simplistic view of the hypervisor driver mechanism.  Furthermore, it
provides APIs for management of virtual networks and storage on the VM
Host Server. The configuration of each VM Guest is stored in an XML
file [@libvirt]. The official website for `libvirt` is located at

* <https://libvirt.org/>



#### QEMU

QEMU is a virtualization technology emulator that allows you to run
operating systems and Linux distributions on your current system
without installing them or burn their ISO files.  When used as a
machine emulator, QEMU can run OSs and programs made for one machine
(e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your own PC). By
using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance.  QEMU
provides two generic functions.  One of them is open source machine
emulator and the other is a virtualizer.

* *Machine emulation:* using it as a machine emulator it runs the OSs
  and programs designed for one machine on a different machine of
  potential different architecture. It uses dynamic translation
  through which it achieves very good performance.

* *Virtualizer:* Using is as a virtualizer it executes the guest code
  directly on the host CPU. This enables QEMU to achieve near native
  performance.

Once QEMU has been installed, it should be ready to run a guest OS
from a disk image. This image is a file that represents the filesystem
and OS on a hard disk. From the perspective of the guest OS, it
actually is a file on hard disk, and it can create its own filesystem
on the virtual disk.

QEMU supports either XEN or KVM to enable virtualization. With the
help of KVM, QEMU can virtualize x86, server and embedded PowerPC,
64-bit POWER, S390, 32-bit and 64-bit ARM, and MIPS guests according
to the [QEMU Wiki](https://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page).

Useful links include the following:

* An extensive manual is provided at
  <https://qemu.weilnetz.de/doc/qemu-doc.html>.

* QEMU can be downloaded from <http://www.qemu.org/download/>.

* A collection of images for testing purposes is provided at
  <https://wiki.qemu.org/Testing/System_Images>

An example for using QEMU is provided in Section
[Virtual Machine Management with QEMU]{@s-qemu-kvm}


#### KVM

KVM, or Kernel-based Virtual Machine is a popular open-source
hypervisor solution. It was released as a virtualization solution
for Linux based systems, and later was merged into Linux Kernel
since version 2.6.20. It was originally supporting x86 hardware
with virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V), but later
supporting of PowerPC and ARM were added. It supports a variety
of different guest OSs, e.g., Windows family, Darwin (the core
of MacOS), in addition to the different distros from various linux
operating systems. The full supported guest list can be found at:
<http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Guest_Support_Status>

The full list of KVM fatures can be found here:
<http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/KVM_Features>.
Among them, some cool features include hot-plugging of hardware
even CPU and PCI devices. It supports live migration of VMs too.

##### KVM vs QEMU

KVM includes a fork of the QEMU executable. The QEMU project focuses
on hardware emulation and portability. KVM focus on the kernel module
and interfacing with the rest of the userspace code.  KVM comes with a
`kvm-qemu` executable that just like QEMU manages the resources while
allocating RAM, loading the code. However instead of recompiling the
code it spawns a thread which calls the KVM kernel module to switch to
guest mode.  It than proceeds to execute the VM code. When privileged
instructions are found, it switches back to the KVM kernel module, and
if necessary, signals the QEMU thread to handle most of the hardware
emulation. This means that the guest code is emulated in a posix
thread which can be managed with common Linux tools [@kvmvsqemu].

#### Xen

Xen is one of the most widely adopted hypervisors by IaaS cloud. It is
supported by the earliest and still the most popular public cloud
offering, i.e., Amazon Web Service (AWS). Eucalyptus, one open-source
effort to replicate what AWS had to offer, and the then most popular
private cloud software, supported Xen from the start. And later Openstack,
the most popular open-source IaaS cloud software at present, also
supports Xen.

Some notable features of Xen includes:

* Supporting x86-64 and ARM for host architecture.

* Supporting live migration of VMs between different physical hosts
without losing the availability.

More detailed list can be found at
<https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_Project_Release_Features>.


#### Hyper-V

Hyper-V is a product from Microsoft to support virtualization on
systems running Windows. Hyper-V was originally released along with
Windows Server 2008, with a separate free version with limited
functionality. In later releases it adds more features, e.g., better
support of Linux guest OS, live migration of VMs, etc.

Hyper-V is still getting a lot of popularity comparing to XEN and KVM
which we attribute to the increasing presence of Microsoft's Azure cloud
offering.

![Popularity of KVM, Xen, and Hyper-V according to Google Trends [Source](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US)](images/kvm-xen-hyperv-gtrends.png){#fig:hypervisor-gtrends}

However overall the search popularity of hypervisors have been
decreasing, as other lightweight virtualization solutions, i.e.,
container technologies become more main stream. We will covered them
in a later chapter.

More detailed information about Hyper-V can be found at
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/hyper-v-architecture>

#### VMWare

VMware is well known for the company bringing hypervisors to the amss
market. The company is now owned by Dell. It has developed the first
type 2 hypervisor. Today VMWare offer type 1 hypervisors and type 2
hypervisors [@wikipedia-vmware].

Because the initial software virtualized "hardware for a video
adapter, a network adapter, and hard disk adapters" as well as
"pass-through drivers for guest USB, serial, and parallel devices"
[@wikipedia-vmware] it provided an attractive solution for many to use
it to run different OSs on their host computers.  One important
advantage is that it does not rely on virtualization extensions to the
x86 instruction set as it was developed before they became
available. This means it can run on many other platforms. However this
advantage is diminished with the ubiquitous available of these
features in the hardware.

### Parallels

Another interesting company offering hypervisors is Parallels. This
company has two main products in that regards:

* Parallels Desktop for Mac, which for x86 machines allows users to
  run virtual machines independently using Windows, Linux, Solaris.

* Parallels Workstation for Microsoft Windows and Linux users which
  for x86 machines allows user to run virtual machines independently
  on the Windows host.

#### VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a free open-source hypervisor for x86 architectures. It
is now owned by Oracle while transitioning from SUN which in turn
acquired the original technology from Innotek.

One of the nice features for us is thet VirtualBox is able to create
and manage guest virtual machines such as Windows, Linux, BSD, OSx86
and even in part also macOS (on Apple hardware). Hence it makes it for
us a very valuable tool while being able to run virtual machines on a
local desktop or computer to simulate cloud resources without
charging cost. In addition we find command line tools such as Vagrant
 that make the use convenient while not having to
utilize the GUI or the more complex virtual box command interfaces. A
guest additions package allows compatibility with the host OS, to for
example allow window management between host and guest OS.

In Section [VirtualBox](#s-virtualbox) we have provided a practical
introduction to VirtualBox.

#### Wine -- Wine is not an emulator

The next software that we introduce is actually not a hypervisor.
However it is very interesting as a contrast to the other approach.
The term Wine has been originally introduced as an acronym for
*Wine Is Not an Emulator*. In contrast to the other approaches Wine
introduces a compatibility layer that allows to run Windows
applications on a number of POSIX-compliant operating systems. This
includes Linux, macOS and BSD. In contrast to using a virtual machine
or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls
[@www-wine]. Hence, it allows to pass the Windows API calls directly
to operating system calls leading to good performance [@www-wine]. The
disadvantage of this approach is that in the early days and till today
some of the underlying calls may not be ported yet and may lead to
applications not running. Those of us that wanted to run for example
Microsoft Word on Linux or macOS, may remember that Wine was the tool
we used to do so even before Word was released on macOS.


#### Comparison of some technologies

QEMU and KVM are better integrated in Linux and has a smaller
footprint.  This may result in better performance. VirtualBox is
targeted as virtualization software and limited to x86 and amd64.  As
Xen uses QEMU it allows hardware virtualization. However, Xen can also
use paravirtualization [@diff-qemu]. In the following table we
summarize support for full- and paravirtualization


|     | XEN | KVM | VirtualBox | VMWare |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Paravirtualization | yes | no | no | no |
|Full virtualization | yes | yes | yes |yes |

### Selected Storage Virtualization Software and Tools

Storage virtualization allows the system to integrate the logical view
of the physical storage resources into a single pool of storage.
Users are unaware while using virtual storage that it is not hosted on
the same hardware resources, such as disks. Storage virtualization is
done across the various layers that build state of the art storage
infrastructures. This includes Storage devices, the Block aggregation
layer, the File/record layer, and the Application layer. Most recently
hosting files as part of the application layer in the cloud is
changing how we approach data storage needs in the enterprise.
A good example for a cloud based virtual storage is google drive.
Other systems include Box, AWS3 and Azure.

### Selected Network Virtualization Software and Tools

Network virtualization allows hardware and software network resources
as well as network functionality to be combined into a single,
software-defined administrative unit which is called a virtual
network. We distinguish external network virtualization that combines
many networks into a unifying network, and internal network
virtualization that provides network functionality to the processes
and containers running on a single server.
