Big Data ... where is it ?

* Often we may not see it because its hidden in lots of data
* Often we can not see it as the data is noisy
* Often we can not see it as the data is unimportant
* Often we can not see it as we have no time to find it
* Often we can not see it as the data is uninteresting
