# Plagiarism

We start our discussion with the review of a most important
topic. Typically you have had alreday a course that covers the topic
of plagiarism. However, we like you to review this chapter anyways and
provide us with a proof that you passed the plagiarizm test. Having
done so will avoid any confusion about if you understand what
plagiarizm is or not.

## Plagiarism Definition

In academic life it is important to understand and avoid plagiarism. The
dictionary defines plagiarism as follows
[dictionary.com](dictionary.com):

pla$\cdot$gia$\cdot$rism

>   "the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing
>   them off as one's own."

## Plagiarism Policies

Organizations and universities will have policies in place do address
plagiarism. An example is provided for Indiana University
[@www-iu-plagiarism]. We quote:

> "Honesty requires that any ideas or materials taken from another
> source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged.
> Offering the work of someone else as one's own is plagiarism. The
> language or ideas thus taken from another may range from isolated
> formulas, sentences, or paragraphs to entire articles copied from
> books, periodicals, speeches, or the writings of other students. The
> offering of materials assembled or collected by others in the form of
> projects or collections without acknowledgment also is considered
> plagiarism. Any student who fails to give credit for ideas or
> materials taken from another source is guilty of plagiarism.
>
> (Faculty Council, May 2, 1961; University Faculty Council, March 11,
> 1975; Board of Trustees, July 11, 1975)"

Faculty members at Universities are also bound by policies that mandate
reporting. At Indiana University the following policy applies (for a
complete policy see the Web page):

> "Should the faculty member detect signs of plagiarism or cheating, it
> is his or her most serious obligation to investigate these thoroughly,
> to take appropriate action with respect to the grades of students, and
> *in any event* to report the matter to the Dean for Student Services
> (or equivalent administrator). The necessity to report every case of
> cheating, whether or not further action is desirable, arises
> particularly because of the possibility that this is not the student's
> first offense, or that other offenses may follow it. Equity also
> demands that a uniform reporting practice be enforced; otherwise, some
> students will be penalized while others guilty of the same actions
> will go free.
>
> (Faculty Council, May 2, 1961)"

Naturally if a student has any questions about understanding plagiarism
the University can provide assistance. If a student is in doubt and asks
for help this is not considered at that time plagiarism.

As you can see from the previous policies, the faculty do not have any
choice but reporting cases of plagiarism to the university
administration. Thus you must not hold them personally responsible as
this is part of the tasks they are required to do if they like it or
not. Instead, it is **the responsibility of the authors of the
document** to assure no plagiarism occurs. If you are a student of a
class that writes a paper or project report this naturally also all
applies to you. In addition, if you work in a team you need to assure
the entire team addresses plagiarism appropriately.

In practice this means that the teachers of a course expect you know
what plagiarism is and you need to be abble to apply it in such a form
in your writings that it does not occur. This is typically taught
in other courses. However, as it is often overlooked by the student we
are pointing it out here so we can make sure you contribute to courses
that require you to write papers and reports. This also means you can
not claim you did not know what plagiarism is. You are required to know
what it is, know how to detect it and know how to avoid it. The
resources provided next will give you the necessary tools and
background.

## Plagiarism Resources

The [School of Education at Indiana
University](http://education.indiana.edu/) has a significant set of
resources to get educated about plagiarism. These resources are intended

## How to Recognize Plagiarism

We are listing fifteen patterns of plagiarism that are defined at

*  <https://www.indiana.edu/~istd/patterns.html>

which we copied into the next table. As such we have not included
quotes but refer to their Web page but instead copied the tables with
a reference. Naturally we do not want to be accused of plagiarize in a
chapter about plagiarism.

## Citation Styles

Each journal or workshop and books will have their own citation
styles. Often we find styles such as APA and Harvard. However these
styles are often not used in scientific writing and tutorials that use
them may provide you with information that is not applicable to other
publications. Hence you need to review the rules for your specific
publication venue carefully. In some cases this will lead to a
significant improvement in readability as well as reduction in space.

While in APA style you may mention

> "John von Neumann (John von Neumann; 1927) describes a turing machine in his
> ground braking paper ... that can do this and that and more.".

However in our community we often focus more on the technology than on
the person or team that did this. Also citations will be precisely
numbered. Hence this will be sufficient:

> "In [1] a turing machine is introduced that can do ..."

Please be reminded that non of our assignments will use APA style
citing. We use numbered ACM or IEEE proceedings and journal citations.

## Exercise

Plagiarism.1:

: Read this document in order for you to undesrtand what plagiarizm is
  and how to cite

Plagiarism.2:

: What is the difference between APA and IEEE style citing? Why do you
  think in science a numbered citing is often prefered?

Plagiarism.3:

: Pass the
  [plagiarism certification](https://www.indiana.edu/~academy/firstPrinciples/certificationTests/index.html).
  This test is mandatory for all students taking this class. Typically
  it should have been done as part of another class, but we found
  through experience that some student that have not taken the
  certification have issues with this topic. Please note, that the
  test requires you to prepare for it with the material that is
  provided on the education web page.
