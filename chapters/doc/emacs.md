# Emacs

Emacs is one of the most powerfull editors. It originated from MIT AI Lab's
Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) while profiding a collection of
macros used for editing. The name *Emacs* originates as an abbreviation for
*Editor MACroS*. modern version of Emacs was rewritten in 1984 and since
than has been evolved and maintained.

A number of extensive documentation is available at the following links
according to the GNU Emacs Home page.

* [GNU Emacs manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html)
* [An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html)
* [Emacs Lisp Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html)
* [Other Emacs manuals](Read Online)

One of the most useful short manuals for emacs is the following reference
card. It takes some time to use this card efficiently, but the most
important commands are written on it. Generations of students have
literally been just presented with this card and they learned emacs
from it.

* <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf>

There is naturally also additional material available and a great
manual. You could also look at

* <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/>

From the last page we have summarized the most useful and **simple**
features. And present them here. One of the gems of emacs is the
ability to recreate replay able macros which we include here also. You
ought to try it and you will find that for data science and the cleanup
of data emacs (applied to smaller datasets) is a gem.

Notation

| Key   | Description |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| C     | Control |
| M     | Esc (meta character) |

Here are some other ways on what to do if you have accidentally pressed
a wrong key:

* `C-g` If you pressed a prefix key (e.g. `C-x`) or you invoked a
  command which is now prompting you for input (e.g. Find file: ...),
  type `C-g`, repeatedly if necessary, to cancel. `C-g` also cancels a
  long-running operation if it appears that Emacs has frozen.

* `C-/` If you executed a command and Emacs has modified your buffer,
  use `C-/` to undo that change.

| Key         | Description |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ---         | **Saving and Exiting** |
| `C-x C-w`   | Write the buffer to file |
| `C-x C-s`   | Write the buffer to file and quit Emacs |
| ---         | **Cursor** *use the cursor keys or ...* |
| `C-f`       | Forward one character |
| `C-n`       | Next line |
| `C-b`       | Back one character |
| `C-p`       | Previous line |
| ---         | **Cursor context move** |
| `C-a`       | Beginning of line |
| `M-f`       | Forward one word |
| `M-a`       | Previous sentence |
| `M-v`       | Previous screen |
| `M-<`       | Beginning of buffer |
| `C-e`       | End of line |
| `M-b`       | Back one word |
| `M-e`       | Next sentence |
| `C-v`       | Next screen |
| `M->`       | End of buffer |
| ---         | **Cursor jump** |
| `M-g` g     | Jump to specified line number |
| ---         | **Search** |
| `C-s`       | Incremental search forward |
| `C-r`       | Incremental search backward |
| ---         | **Replace** |
| `M-`%       | Query replace |
| ---         | **Killing ("cutting") text** |
| `C-k`       | Kill line |
| `C-y`       | Yanks last killed text |
| ---         | **Macros** |
| `M-x (`     | Start recording macro |
| `M-x )`     | Stop recording macro |
| `M-x e`     | Play back macro once |
| `M-5 C-x-e` | Play back macro 5 times |

Modes

> "Every buffer has an associated major mode, which alters certain
> behaviors, key bindings, and text display in that buffer. The idea is to
> customize the appearance and features available based on the contents of
> the buffer."

modes are typically activated by ending such as `.py`,
`.java`, `.rst`, ...

|  Key                 |   Description |
|  ----- |  ------------------------ |
|  `M-x python-mode`      | Mode for editing Python files |
|  `M-x auto-fill-mode`   | Wraps your lines automatically when they  get longer than 70 characters. |
|  `M-x flyspell-mode`    | Highlights misspelled words as you type. |

## Org Mode

Emacs has some very advanced features that you can activate via a mode.
One such feature is to organize a TODO list via org-mode.

## Programming Python with Emacs

Emacs comes by default with syntax highlighting for python when you
edit a `.py` file. This is really all you need. It also comes with a
python ide that you can use and customize.

Python auto-completion for Emacs:

## Emacs Keys in a Terminal

One of the real great features of knowing emacs is that you can set all
your editors to emacs shortcuts. This includes pyCharm, but also bash.
In bash you simply say

```bash
$ set -o emacs
```

in your bash prompt. Additionally, if you do not have a window systems
configured, you can run emacs directly in the terminal with

```bash
$ emacs -nw
```

This you can log in to a remote computer and if it has emacs installed.
Use it in the terminal. This would replace editors such as vi, vim,
nano, pico or others that work in a terminal.

## LaTeX and Emacs

LaTeX is directly supported by emacs and nothing has to be changed.
However, a collection of information about additional LaTeX features for
emacs is available at

* <https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LaTeX>

Of interest are for example also

* `M-x flyspell-mode`: allowing to do spell checking in the window
* predictive mode: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PredictiveMode
* preview latex
* whizzy tex

However instead of previews and whizzy tex we recommend to use

* <https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LatexMk>

which comes pre-installed and allows you to do editing in one terminal,
while previewing the update on change in another window.

## LateXMk and Emacs

LatexMk allows one to outomatically compike and preview a document
in case theire source is changed. THus if you run LateXMk and edit
your files for example with emacs, The PDF viewer such as skim will
automatically update the document.
This is similar to overleaf, but much faster and without collaborators editing the same file.
