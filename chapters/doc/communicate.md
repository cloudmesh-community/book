## General Remarks about Communication

Please do not use the e-mail of TA's and Instructors to communicate
with them. They are **NOT** allowed to answer any questions send to
them via e-mail. Instead use piazza and in some cases github issues.

The reason is simple. The class is managed by multiple people. If you
send mail to an individual others (either instructors, TAs, or student
can not see it).

Please read carefully and experiment practically how to communicate
with piazza.

An assignment to post a **formal** bio is typically given to not only
test your ability to use piazza, but also introduce yourself to the
class.
