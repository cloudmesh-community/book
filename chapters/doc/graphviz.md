# Graphviz

Graphviz is a tool that allows you to visualize structural information
with the help of abstract graphs and networks. It is achieved while
providing the graph with automatic layout algorithms so you can focus
on the creation of dependencies between nodes through edges. The main
Web page is located at

* <https://graphviz.gitlab.io/resources/>

## Installation

On macOS you can install graphviz with

```bash
$ brew install graphviz
```

On macOS there is also a graphviz version available that includes a GUI.
The link to this software is:

* <http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/>

It can be downloaded from

* <http://www.pixelglow.com/downloads/graphviz-1.13-v16.dmg>

There is also an additional tool that is distributed by the community
that is called doteditor and can be installed with

```bash
$ brew cask install doteditor
```

If you have issues with brew cask install, you can also install it by
hand while going to

* <https://vincenthee.github.io/DotEditor/>

Online versions of graphviz are also available, but we have not tested
them

* <http://www.webgraphviz.com/>
* <https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/>
* <http://viz-js.com/>
* <http://graphviz.it/\#/gallery/unix.gv>

There are many more versions available. Please contribute to this
section to improve it

## Usage

To use graphviz create a dot file and run the following command.

```bash
$ dot -Tpng filename.dot -o filename.png
```

This will create a png file. Other formats are also possible such as
svg, or PDF

```bash
$ dot -Tsvg filename.dot -o filename.svg
$ dot -TPDF filename.dot -o filename.pdf
```

For inclusion in latex documents we recommend you create PDF output as it
has a much better quality and is smaller in size than png.

### The Dot Format

An extensive documentation is provided at

* <https://graphviz.gitlab.io/documentation/>

From there we find also the most simplest Hello World Graph>

```bash
$ echo "digraph G {Hello->World}" | dot -Tpng > hello.png
```

## Exercise


Graphviz.1:

: Develop a REST service that takes a graph as input and returns a rendered version of the graph in a specified format. Make sure you can pass the format as a parameter.

Graphviz.2:

: Develop a REST service that takes a graph as input and returns a URL of the rendered graph while storing the output onto a data server. The data server is another rest service, from which the result can be picked up.

Graphviz.3:

: For IU students. Develop a REST service that takes a graph as input and returns a URL of the rendered graph while storing the output onto a data server. The data server is another rest service, from which the result can be picked up. Use box and/or google drive that are offered by IU as services. Make sure not to expose your passwords or access keys
