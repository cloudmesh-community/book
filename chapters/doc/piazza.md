Piazza
------

We use Piazza (<https://piazza.com>) because questions and answers on
Piazza are community-edited and provides the opportunity not only for
instructors, but also for students to contribute. Each question has a
single answer edited by the students of the class and if needed an
instructors' answer that is collaboratively edited by the instructors.

Due to this wiki-style question and answer, when a student has a
question, one does not have to look through long e-mail threads but
instead can look at the answer. For details that lead up to the answer
you are highly encouraged to also look at some comments that lead up
to the answer.

An advertisement video from Piazza summarizes the features:

### Access to Piazza from Canvas

Piazza is one of the recommended IU supported technologies within
CANVAS. It replaces the CANVAS discussion groups with superior
technology targeted to support large student classes while also
focusing on student engagement.

To access piazza you can have the following situations provided in the
next four subsections. Please read **ALL** of them **CAREFULLY**, decide
which applies tou you and follow the instructions. If you have
improvements to this instructions, please let us know.

### Piazza for 516

Due to a bug in canvas the piazza location for 516 could not be
crosslisted to CANVAS. Thus we simply add the following link to it

https://piazza.com/iu/fall2018/516

This link is used also for the undergraduates and the CS students

If you ahave any issues with enrolling in Piazza, please contact us
in the office hours.

 
### Piazza for other classes

#### Situation: You have never logged into piazza

#### Situation: You have logged into piazza and used your default IU e-mail

1.  Click the Piazza link on the left navigation of your Canvas course.
2.  You will be automatically enrolled in the course Piazza site and
    logged in.
3.  Start using Piazza.

#### Situation: You have logged into piazza and you used another non IU e-mail

1.  Click the Piazza link on the left navigation of your Canvas course.
2.  Proceed as in \#1 above. This will create your new Piazza account
    that is linked to your courses in Canvas. This is the account you
    should always use in your IU courses.
3.  If you wish to merge other accounts that you own, please see [Add an
    email address or merge two
    accounts](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://support.piazza.com/customer/portal/articles/1646661-add-an-email-address-or-merge-two-accounts&sa=D&ust=1502127148503000&usg=AFQjCNHyBFh3TMAtSDpFordYOfH0IE6kPA).

#### Situation: You have multiple accounts in piazza

I post the official response form the CANVAS team here: "When a student
clicks the Piazza link in your course navigation, they will be
authenticated through to Piazza. If the student already has a Piazza
account that matches their default Canvas email, they will simply be
enrolled in the Piazza course. If the student does not have an account,
Canvas sends the pertinent information (default email address primarily)
to Piazza, Piazza creates the student's account and enrolls the student
in the Piazza course. There is nothing you need to do to."

If you have any questions regarding accessing piazza, please send them
to

"Ricci, Margaret P" \<[](mailto:mricci@iu.edu)\>

### Verify you are on Piazza via a post

Post in the **bio** folder a short introduction about yourself. One that
you could include in a paper.

An example is provided at <https://laszewski.github.io/bio.html> with an
image at <https://laszewski.github.io/_images/gregor.jpg>

Use the subject line *Biography: Firstname Lastname* and post it into
the bio folder.

### Making Piazza Work

In order for Piazza to work students and instructors need to participate

**Students participate:** Students must collaboratively work on an
answer to a question. Students must not post irrelevant followups to a
question. If you notice your comment was irrelevant, please delete it.
Students must **search** prior to asking a new question if the question
has already been asked. Duplicated questions can be merged.

**Instructors guide:** The instructor guides the students in order to
obtain an answer to a question. In some cases the instructor may be the
only one knowing the answer in which case he tries to provide it.

**Not using e-mail:** Instructors will and must not use e-mail to
communicate with a student. All communication will be done via piazza.
There, are only very view situations where e-mail is allowed, ask on
piazza first if you should engage in e-mail conversations.

**Not using CANVAS discussions:** We will not engage in any CANVAS
message exchange. Any communication is to be done on Piazza. It is in
your responsibility to enroll in Piazza to make it work for you.
Instructions are posted in this document. (Grade discussion will be done
in CANVAS)

### Towards good questions

Naturally when you ask a question you need to do it in a reasonable form
and provide sufficient information so that the question can be answered.
It is in the responsibility of the student to update the question to
provide enough information.

Thus information may include: Firstname Lastname, HID, and URL to
document in question

To give you an example of a **bad** question consider:

    *send from Xi Lee*

    Hi Professor:

    I read a nice article about apples
    and potato's and updated my
    paper. Please give me feedback

    Thank you

    Kevin

Here the reasons why this can be improved:

1.  As professors and instructors may review your document it is
    unnecessary to start with "Hi Professor:", just leave it away. If
    you want a particular instructor use the name explicitly, such as
    "Gregor:", e.g. multiple professors may be teaching your course.
2.  You have not specified which article you read, you need to include
    the **URL** to the article so we can follow your argument.
3.  You have not included the **URL** to your document so we do not know
    what you are talking about. Remember there are many others students
    in the class.
4.  You are using a different name from the one that you are registered
    with. This can lead to confusion when we look up your name. We
    prefer that you use only one name that is associated with your
    e-mail.

The above question will simply be commented on (if at all):

"Missing information" or "?" indicating that information is missing.

It is in your responsibility to figure out which information is missing.
You need to modify the original post and.

### Guide on how to ask good questions

This guide is adapted from

-   <http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/how-ask-question-when-you-want-technical-help.htm>

Steps to getting your question answered on piazza

1.  Before you even go to ask a question, think through what your
    problem is. Write down how you are going to describe it. Think about
    it from the other side - what would you need to know if a student
    came to you and asked the question? Gather all the system
    information that seems to bear on the problem (see how at this
    link). Sometimes it even happens that by thinking through the
    problem, you come up with the answer yourself.

2.  Verify that your question has not yet been answered with a search on
    the Web, Class Web page, or class piazza, this may require multiple
    searches.

3.  In case it is a technical question, write down any error codes that
    appear on your screen. Do **not use screenshots** if the text is
    characters. This is because a reply my need to paste and copy from
    the original. Also screenshots are not searchable. We will not
    answer any questions that post screenshots if they are not
    necessary. It is far easier to copy and paste and use terminal type
    in the formatting. Also if the text is posted it is searchable. (Any
    unnecessary screenshot will receive a point deduction. Based on
    experience we have to do this as previous students in other classes
    ignored this policy).

4.  Place your question or problem in a forum that is relevant to its
    subject. That may seem obvious but anyone who has experience with
    forums knows that a lot of questions show up in the wrong place. YOu
    will need to identify one or more a fitting piazza "folders"
    (folders sort the posts by topics).

5.  Select a title that briefly and accurately describes your problem. A
    title like "Help!" or "Computer will not work" will often get ignored.
    Almost any problem can be titled with a few key words that will
    raise interest in somebody who is familiar with the subject. A
    corollary to this is to avoid using all caps or a lot of exclamation
    points. Something like "HELP!!!" turns many people off.

6.  In the post, briefly describe the problem in a paragraph. Leave out
    unnecessary details. Save everybody time by listing any solutions
    that you have tried but did not work. Avoid using screenshots if they
    are not needed. (I mention this again).

7.  In case of a technical issue describe relevant system details. For
    example, it is essential to designate your operating system and type
    of computer and any components that might be involved in your
    problem. List any error code that has been displayed. Be prepared to
    provide more details if asked.

8.  Tell what you were doing when you encountered the problem. If it is
    a reproducible problem, list the steps or computer operations that
    cause the problem.

9.  If applicable, List any recent software you have installed or
    hardware changes you have made. If you have updated any drivers
    recently, also list that.

10. Formulate your questions and answers in a courteous manner. Respect
    the answers from others. Somebody is giving you their time and
    expertise for free. You may want to come back to the forum and it
    pays to be friendly.

11. If a suggested solution works, be sure to return to piazza and
    report your success. It is the least you can do to return something
    for the help you have been given. It will make you welcome in the
    forum the next time you go there for help.

### Piazza class Links

:warning: Using the direct links listed in the next two sections, can
lead to you not getting proper access via Canvas. If you click on
these links **before they create** the account via the link in your
current Canvas course, you will create an account that is not matched
up with Canvas. To avoid issues make sure you integrate to piazza via
Canvas first.

If you have questions about this contact Margaret Ricci (mricci@iu.edu).

### Piazza Curation

We are using Piazza in a curated fashion.  This means that we try to
file posts into folders and delete messages that are not relevant or
do not provide any additional information. It also means that if you
see an error in the post that students and instructors have provided,
you should improve it. This may include spelling errors.

As part of the curation we are introducing a number of folders.
The folders may vary from class and we can add new folders if
needed. Please let us know.

We provide next a list of example folders that we have used in
previous classes and list their purpose. Please help us to add folders
form your class.

  Folder       Description
  ------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  logistics    Any question and discussion related to the logistics of the course.
  lectures     Any question and discussion related to the lectures.
  project      Any question and discussion related to the project.
  chapter      Any question and discussion related to the chapter assignment
  tutorial     Any question and discussion related to the tutorial assignment.
  python       Any question and discussion related to python.
  pi           Any question and discussion related to the Raspberry Pi 3. We are not using older Raspberry Pi's and therefore can not comment to them.
  bio          A homework folder in which you only publish your bio. The bio needs to be published as a *note*. This assignment also serves us to see if you are in piazza. Please do this assignment ASSAP. You need to post a formal bio. See the many great examples in the folder.
  help         If you need help and none of the other folders fits, please use this folder. If information from here will result into new Web page content it will be added and marked into the folder *resolved*. See the *resolved* folder for more detail.
  resolved     Sometimes we move some general help messages to the resolved folder in case the help message results into information that is posted on our class Web page. We than will add a link to where in the class Web page this question was answered. The TAs will aggressively try to put information into the Web page.
  discussion   Any content that deserves its separate discussion and is not covered in the above folder.

In addition to these general folders we also have two folders which
**MUST NOT BE USED BY ANY STUDENT TO POST CONTENT**. These folders serve
to communicate your assignments and are used internally between Gregor
and the TA's. Please do not mark any questions about assignments with
the assignments folder, but instead use help

*assignments*:

:   This folder only lists the assignments. At any time in the class you
    can click on the assignment folder and list the assignments given to
    the class. Thus there is no confusion which assignments have been
    given. In case students have questions about assignments they should
    not use the *assignments* folder, but the *help* folder. TAs are
    instructed to correct wrongly filed messages in folders.

In case you decide to post privately and the information is useful for
others also, the message will be published to the class.

### Read the Originals, not just the e-mail

Piazza provides a convenient mechanism to update you through e-mail when
an answer is changed or when someone posts.

---

:warning: In many cases additional information is available for the
post and it is **not sufficient to just read the mail**.

---

The mail is just a reminder that something happened. Use the
`<click here>` feature in the mail to get not only to the update, but to
the actual post. Than you can get reminded about the information that is
part of the post and potentially answers your question in full. It is not
sufficient to participate in this class while only reading email, you
should participate while visiting piazza and actively contribute to it.

### Exercises

Piazza.1

:   Enroll in piazza

Piazza.2

:   Post a short formal bio in the bio folder and optionally include a
    professional portrait of yourself. Make sure you understand what a
    formal bio and portrait is. Research this in the internet. Look at
    IEEE papers for examples.

Piazza.3

:   How do you find out within Piazza which assignments have been
    posted?

Piazza.4

:   Please watch the Video about Piazza

Piazza.5

: Why is it important to not just read the piazza e-mail, but to visit
  the post by using the `<click here>` feature in the mail?
