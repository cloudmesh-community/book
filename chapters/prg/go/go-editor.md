# Editors Supporting Go :white_check_mark: {#s-go-editor}

A large number of editor compatibilities and plugins are listed at 

* <https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins>

We recommend that you identify an editor form that list that will work for you.
Due to the universality of emacs and its use for managing LaTeX as ewll as bibtex,
we recommend that you use emacs, Important is that the editor supports
lin breaks at the 80 character limit so the code is no=icely formatted
for github. If your editor does not support this feature use emacs.

Other editors may include

- [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go) which however in contrast to
  PyCharm is not free. However as student and faculty one can get a
  free license via <https://www.jetbrains.com/student/>
- [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/go-plus),
- [vim](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go)

If any of the editors support Go and have proper line limit support
please let us know and we add it here.

:o: How does your editor supprt 80 character limit?

You should identity which works best for you and set it up.
