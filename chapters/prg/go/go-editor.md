# Editors Supporting Go {#s-go-editor}

A large number of editor compatibilities and plugins are listed at

* <https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins>

We recommend that you identify an editor form that list that will work for you.
Due to the universality of emacs and its use for managing LaTeX as ewll as bibtex,
we recommend that you use emacs, Important is that the editor supports
lin breaks at the 80 character limit so the code is no=icely formatted
for github. If your editor does not support this feature use emacs.

If your version of emacs does not yet have support for go, yo ucan
find the go mode at

* <https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GoMode> [?]

The documentation to it is provided at
