# Exercises

When doing your assignment, make sure you label the programs
appropriately with comments that clearly identify the assignment. 
Plase all assignments in a folder on github named "cloudmesh-exercises"

For example name the program solving E.Cloudmesh.Common.1
`e-cloudmesh-1.py` and so on. For more complex assignments you can name
thame as you like, as long as in the file you have a comment such as 

```# fa19-516-000 E.Cloudmesh.Common.1```

at the beginning of the file. Please **do not store** any screenshots in
your git repository of your working program.
