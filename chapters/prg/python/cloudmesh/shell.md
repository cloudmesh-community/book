# Shell

Python provides a sophisticated method for starting backen processe.
However in moany cases it is quite complex to interact with it. It also
does not provide convenient wrappers that we can use to start them in a
pythonic fashin. For this reason we have written a primitve `Shell`
class that provides just enouch functionality to be useful in many
cases.

Let us itterate its use over some examples where the value in result returns the output of the command.


```python
from cloudmesh.common.Shell import Shell


Shell.execute('pwd')
print(result)

result = Shell.execute('ls', ["-l", "-a"])
print(result)

result = Shell.execute('ls', "-l -a")
print(result)
```

For many commands we also provide build in functions`

```python
result = Shell.ls("-aux")
print(result)

result = Shell.ls("-a", "-u", "-x")
print(result)

result = Shell.pwd()
print(result)
```
