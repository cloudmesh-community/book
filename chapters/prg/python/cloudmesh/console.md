# Output

Cloudmesh provides a number of convenient API's to make output easier
or more fancyful. 

These API's include

* [Console](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/api/cloudmesh.common.html#module-cloudmesh.common.console)
* [Banner](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/api/cloudmesh.common.html?highlight=banner#cloudmesh.common.util.banner)
* [Heading](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/api/cloudmesh.common.html?highlight=heading#cloudmesh.common.util.HEADING)
* [VERBOSE](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/api/cloudmesh.common.html?highlight=verbose#cloudmesh.common.debug.VERBOSE)

## Console {#sec:cloudmesh-console}

Print is the usual function to output to the terminal. However, often we
like to have colored output that helps us in the notification to the
user. For this reason we have a simple `Console` class that has several
built-in features. You can even switch and define your own color
schemes.

```python
from cloudmesh.common.console import Console


msg = "my message"

Console.ok(msg) # prins a green message
Console.error(msg) # prins a red message proceeded with ERROR
Console.msg(msg) # prins a regular black message
```

In case of the error message we also have convenient flags that allow us
to include the traceback in the output.

```python
Console.error(msg, prefix=True, traceflag=True)
```

The prefix can be switched on and off with the prefix flag, while the
traceflag switches on and of if the trace should be set.

The verbosity of the output is controlled via variables that are stored
in the `~/.cloudmesh` directory.

```python
from cloudmesh.common.variables import Variables

variables = Variables()

variables['debug'] = True
variables['trace'] = True
variables['verbose'] = 10

```

For more features, see API: [Console](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/api/cloudmesh.common.html#module-cloudmesh.common.console)


## Banner

In case you need a banner you can do this with

```python
from cloudmesh.common.util import banner

banner("my text")
```

For more features, see API: [Banner](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/api/cloudmesh.common.html?highlight=banner#cloudmesh.common.util.banner)

## Heading

A particular useful function is `HEADING()` which prints the method name.

```python

from cloudmesh.common.util import HEADING

class Example(object):

    def doit(self):
        HEADING()
        print ("Hello")
```

The invocation of the `HEADING()` function doit prints a banner with the name
information. The reason we did not do it as a decorator is that you can
place the `HEADING()` function in an arbitrary location of the method body.

For more features, see API: [Heading](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/api/cloudmesh.common.html?highlight=heading#cloudmesh.common.util.HEADING)

## VERBOSE

VERBOSE is a very useful method allowing you to print a
dictionary. Not only will it print the dict, but it will also provide
you with the information in which file it is used and which line
number. It will even print the name of the `dict` that you use in your
code.

To use this you will have to enable the debugging methods for
cloudmesh as discused in @sec:cloudmesh-console

```python
from cloudmesh.common.debug import VERBOSE

m = {"key": "value"}
VERBOSE(m)
```

For more features, please see [VERBOSE](https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/api/cloudmesh.common.html?highlight=verbose#cloudmesh.common.debug.VERBOSE)



## Using print and pprint

In many cases it may be sufficient to use `print` and `pprint` for
debugging. However, as the code is big and you may forget where you placed
print statements or the print statements may have been added by others, we
recommend that you use the VERBOSE function. If you use `print` or `pprint`
we recommend using a unique prefix, such as:

```python
from pprint import pprint

d = {"sample": "value"}
print("MYDEBUG:")
pprint (d)

# or with print

print("MYDEBUG:", d)
```
