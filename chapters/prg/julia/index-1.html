<h2 id="parallel-computing">Parallel Computing</h2>
<p>Though not intended as a replacement for Hadoop, parallelism in Julia is fairly
straight-forward. [www-wired]</p>

<p>Julia is also optimized for high performance computing in a distributed
environment.</p>
<p>Parallelism in Julia is constructed via Coroutines which use communication
primitives  to communicate between processes. The Channel function in Julia
makes passing variables, results, and objects between tasks possible.
[@www-julialang]. To create a Channel of size(int) we pass in:</p>
<p><code>julia
c1 = Channel(32)</code></p>
<p>We can also specify a Type{T} before the size, though if not specified, the
Channel can hold any type object.</p>
<p>The Julia documentation [@www-julialang] provides a simple example of creating
results in one Channel and taking them into a second Channel.</p>
<p>```julia
c1 = Channel(32)
c2 = Channel(32)</p>
<h1 id="and-a-function-foo-which-reads-items-from-c1-processes-the-item-read">and a function <code>foo</code> which reads items from c1, processes the item read</h1>
<h1 id="and-writes-a-result-to-c2">and writes a result to c2,</h1>
<p>function foo()
    while true
        data = take!(c1)
        [...]               # process data
        put!(c2, result)    # write out result
    end
end</p>
<h1 id="we-can-schedule-n-instances-of-foo-to-be-active-concurrently">we can schedule <code>n</code> instances of <code>foo</code> to be active concurrently.</h1>
<p>for _ in 1:n
    @async foo()
end
```</p>
<p>While development and interactivity between Spark, Hadoop, and
Julia is robust, the documentation is limited. The Elly.jl package [@elly-jl]
is a Hadoop and Yarn client for Julia. We focus here on the Hadoop
functionality. </p>
