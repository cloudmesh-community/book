# Julia :o:

:warning: Although we do not intend to use julia in this class, we
provid ethe option for a small number of students to develop this
chapter as part of the course requirements. In case you chose it, you
could also investigate how to use the cloud from it as to potentially
do your project in julia. Your project would be to develop a cloud
client in julia similar to the one wie developed in pythin under the
name cloudmesh.
