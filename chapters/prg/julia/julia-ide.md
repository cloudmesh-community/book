# Julia IDE


Note: in Juno, the "Auto-hide Menu Bar" option can turn off the File menu.  If you find this disabled and the "Settings" window is unavailable, search for the Auto-Hide setting by typing ```Ctrl   + Shift + P```, then typing ```Auto-hide``` in the search bar.  Ensure the option is de-selected.
