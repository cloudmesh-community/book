## Julia IDE

As stated in earlier sections, there are several development
environments and editors to use for Julia.  For purposes of the
following sections, Juno (Atom) will be the primary IDE.

### Install Atom

Assuming Julia is already installed, download and install the
appropriate Atom distribution from <https://atom.io/>.  Ensure that
the version is up-to-date (v1.23 or higher).

### Install Juno

To install Juno within Atom, go to the Settings > Install panel.  Type
`uber-juno` into the search bar and hit enter.  Find the
`uber-juno` package and install. After Atom installs Juno, simply
restart Atom. For further instructions, visit the installation page at
<http://docs.junolab.org/latest/man/installation/>.  Use the REPL with
Packages > Julia > Open Console.

*Note*: in Juno, the "Auto-hide Menu Bar" option can turn off the File
menu.  This can be disorienting. If you find this disabled and the
"Settings" window is unavailable, search for the Auto-Hide setting by
typing `Ctrl + Shift + P`, then typing `Auto-hide` in the
search bar.  Ensure the option is de-selected. Alternatively, hit the
`Alt` key to toggle the menu bar.
