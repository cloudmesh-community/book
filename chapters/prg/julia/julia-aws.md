# AWS in Julia

There are two Julia libraries that provide programmatic interface with AWS: AWS.jl and AWSCore.jl. We will focus on
AWSCore.jl, as it is under active development and provides more infrastructure types and high-level packages. We include
a note about AWS.jl for completeness. The following information can be found at
<https://juliacloud.github.io/AWSCore.jl/build/index.html>

## AWSCore.jl

AWSCore.jl (hereinafter AWSCore) was only successfully tested on Julia 0.6.0. Note that multiple versions of Julia can
be installed and run by linking the binary files to the shell session while using bash and the Julia REPL.  See
"Installing Julia" for more information.

### Credentials

Most AWSCore functions take an ```AWSConfig``` dictionary as an initial argument, which passes in both credentials and
region variables.  Credentials can be gathered either from the default ```/.aws/credentials``` file or by setting them
as environment variables as discussed elsewhere in this chapter.

AWSCore will attempt to read in credentials from (in order) Environment Variables, an ```~/.aws/credentials``` file, or
EC2 Instance Credentials which can be set via the AWS CLI. Note that the third method is not recommended!*
 
Here, we use an AWS Credentials file located ```~/.aws/credentials``` (Ubuntu).  Ensure that the user has appropriate
permissions to create, delete, and modify AWS objects and services. We begin with a simple script that will allow
creation of S3 containers. To set up a script that will create an S3 container and store a simple object, we initialize
the Julia Dev environment.    First, create a new directory called "Julia App" and populate with one ```.jl``` file:

```bash
> mkdir JuliaApp
> cd JuliaApp
> touch julia-app.jl
```

Assuming Julia is properly installed, simply type the command for the executable created earlier. For instance,
```julia0.6```. This will start a Julia REPL inside the JuliaApp directory just created. Open a text/file editor to edit
the julia-app.jl file:

```emacs julia-app.jl```

Julia is comparable to Python in its import statements in that to use a particular package or library, the user must
specify that package prior to its use.  With the blank ```.jl``` open, import and initialize the following packages:

```julia
> Pkg.add("AWSCore")
> Pkg.add("AWSS3")
> using AWSS3
> using AWSCore.Services
```

Now include in the script the AWS_Config() argument, which typically contains AWS Credentials and a Region parameter:

```julia
> aws = AWSCore.aws_config()
```

Before proceeding, save the file and run the script in the opened Julia REPL.  Make sure that the working directory is
the same as where your script is located by issuing in Julia ```pwd()```.  To run the script, type in the Julia REPL:

```julia
> import Pkg
> include("julia-app.jl")
```

Read AWS credentials into your environment session by adding the following command to your script: 

```julia
> aws = aws_config()
```

### S3 Containers

You should see some output indicating that the credentials have been created or read successfully. Now we can create a
bucket and put an object in the bucket. Very basically, the syntax for creating a bucket using the low-level AWSCore
services is: ```s3_create_bucket(credentials, bucketname```).  Add the following to your script, ensuring that your name
complies with AWS bucket naming conventions:

```julia
s3_create_bucket(aws, "<bucket.name>")
s3_enable_versioning(aws, "<bucket.name>")
```

#### Listing buckets and Objects

Now we can run our script and verify that the bucket was created (see running Julia script above). We will further
develop this script to include docopts to make managing S3 buckets and objects much easier. To expand on the previous
example, add in the ```s3_list_buckets(credentials)``` or ```list_objects(credentials, bucket)``` functions.

#### Adding objects to existing bucket

```julia
> s3_put(aws, "<bucket.name>", "key", "Hello!")
```

## AWS.jl

Julia's AWS API (AWS.jl) is straightforward to configure and is similar to Python. Using the Julia-AWS API carries the
advantage of users not having to switch between environments and languages. The API functionality in Julia is currently
limited, however, to EC2, S3, SQS, and Auto Scaling. <https://github.com/JuliaCloud/AWS.jl>. Advanced APIs have not been
tested yet. Further development is in progress with the AWSSDK.jl package.
