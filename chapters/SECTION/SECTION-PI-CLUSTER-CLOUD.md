# [Cloud Clusters]{.part}

In this chapter we will be looking at a number of clusters that are
typically associated with cloud computing this includes

* docker
* docker swarm
* kubernetes
* hadoop
* spark

If you know about other efforts let us know and we add them here.

For each of the cluster sections we assume that you have setup a cluster of Pis
according to the instructions in the [Network of Pis](#pi-now-main) section.
Please see that section for any questions about the initial setup.
