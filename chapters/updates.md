* March 1, 2019: Map reduce is an essential concept that needs to be
  understood properly inorder to work with Big data frameworks such
  as Apache Spark and Hadoop. The introduction to map reduce section
  (see @sec:map-reduce) covers the basics of the map reduce concepts 
  and the Hadoop section (see @sec:hadoop-introduction) shows how the
  concept of map reduce is implemented in Apache Hadoop.

  @sec:swagger-verify).

* Feb 12, 2019: The Mongo DB section has been updated (see
  @sec:mongodb-python). It also has been made more prominent while
  changing the placement in the Python chapter outline.  A new
  quickstart section for MongoDB was added (see
  @sec:mongodb-cloudmesh).

* Feb 12, 2019: The Google products page has been updated but will be
  moved to the Appandix just as the AWS, Azure and Watson lists (see

  (see @sec:git-pillrequest).

* Jan 23, 2019: Changed the cloud links to view only instead of going
  directly into the editor. Separated the REST md file inte several
  files so we can reorder them and start with OpenAPI instead of

  references in markdown in Section Notation; Updated the github issues
  in the preface; remove the obsolete abbreviation section for the

* Jan 15, 2019: Slight improvements in the Quick Start:
  Removed the redundant project definition; Added the
  Technology ePub link; simplified the Project description; Clarified
  the use of the Workbreakdown section and added todo items to the
  Workbreakdown section requirements for better
  interaction in discussions with TAs throughout the semester.

* Jan 15, 2019: experimented On OSX on the install of pandoc via cabal
  and installed pandoc-citeproc via cabal. This is documented at

  <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc>

  This breaks installation instructions for Linux/ubuntu. For ubuntu we
  have created an experimental untested install script if containers
  can not be used.
