# FAQ

In this section TA's and students can add FAQ's from the piazza. As
the material especially the programming related one is so useful that
it is shared by now in multiple classes, however they use different
piazza's sharing the information in an FAQ in the handbook allows us
to quickly disseminate the relevant information between classes. If an
FAQ is only for one class we will be especially mark it.

## Where to find the FAQ as markdown?

https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/faq.md


## Why are some FAQs that are on piazza not here?

Two reason:

1. some of them need not to be in this FAQ.

2. The TAs will evaluate the FAQs every day at the end of the day and
   integrate those that need to be in this list at that time. Hence it
   may take up to 24 hours for FAQs to appear here.

Once an FAQ is in the book answered (it may actually be part of
another section, TAs will mark the FAQ in piazza, so you can make sure
which FAQs are already in the book. We recommend to look in the book
as there could be information in it that you otherwise missed.

## Can I assume that all information is in the FAQ to do the class?

No. The class book will be our main source of information not just a
single file.

## 516: Why have the individual lectures been removed from the resources section?

We identified that someone after almost three weeks has not looked at
the epub and missed valuable information. To force students to look at
the epub we have removed the direct links to the md files in piazza
`Resources` section. Instead we still leave the links to the md file
sin the syllabus so that you can still get to them from the syllabus.
This way also room for error is minimized as we only have to update
one file wit the location and not two.

The little clouds in the epub are automatically created and provide
a direct link to the md file for which the content follows.
