# How to use Git in this class


Let us use the first homework *TechList 1* as an example to illustrate
why and how we choose Git as a essential tool in this class.

In the *Technologies* section on the class website, we will
collaboratively edit the web page contents. Each student shall add their
paragraphs about certain tech topics. This leads to a question: multiple
authors are working on a same document, whose version should be used as
the final version? After all, there can only be one version published
online.

Git can largely (not completely) help use sort it out. And here is our
Git workflow:

* Step 1

  In the class official repo, we start from an empty TechList file. Here
  is the file we start from in our class repo:
  <https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes/blob/master/docs/source/i524/technologies.rst>

* Step 2

  Each student is going to create a repository exactly the same as the
  official repo. This step is called to `fork` the repo. You do so by
  click the `fork` button on the top right corner of the page. Once done,
  you have your own copy of the class repo.

* Step 3

  You create this repo in your Github account. This means you still store
  everything online remotely.

* Step 4

  To conveniently edit the files, you need a copy on your laptop. This is
  to `clone` your personal repo to your local disk. Look at your Github
  repo and find a green button saying `clone or download`. Click this
  button and you will have a pulldown menu where you should copy the URL.
  In your terminal/commandline, run `git clone <the URL you just
  copied>`. This step copies the project to your own disk for editing.

* Step 5

  Your local copy is a `live` version, since you are going to keep editing
  it. Put your contents in the `technologies.rst` file in the
  corresponding sections.

* Step 6

  At any point during your editing, if you want to secure the changes you
  made to the file, you can always `commit`. Refer to the `git commit`
  instruction. Obviously, when you finish all the typing, a `commit`
  operation must be performed. Consider a `commit` operation a fancy
  `save` operation you may always do during file editing. A major
  advantage is, `commit` will keep a history of all the versions you
  committed. All the committed texts will not be lost. This reduces a lot
  of risks during long term, large scale development.

* Step 7

  When you complete your work, it is the time to submit your homework back
  to the graders. Do this in two steps. First, you have to `push` your
  local disk copy to the repo you created under your account in step 4).
  Follow closely after this link
  <https://github.com/cloudmesh/classes#submitting-changes> to get your
  local disk and your personal remote a.k.a. the `origin` synchronized.
  Second step is done via your browser. At the very top of your repo web
  page, switch to the `pull requests` tab, and submit a pull request to
  the class repo. This way, the instructor will get notified and merge
  your repo into the class official repo. After this merge being
  performed, all your contributions will be included into the public site.
