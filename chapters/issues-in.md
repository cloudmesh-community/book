| Internal: | Assigned to a staff member and done internally by them |
| Open: | A task is open and can be executed also by students. |
| Assigned: | A task is assigned and is currently been executed by the assignee |

Assignees can change the summary to done. We will experiment with possibly additional labels to communicate the state via labels. Please stay tuned.
